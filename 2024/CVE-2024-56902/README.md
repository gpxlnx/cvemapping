> Accounts list before we start attack [We own the Guest account]

The Guest account by default is not authorized to read the list of accounts, but because of Broken Access Control vulnerability ([CVE-2024-56898](https://github.com/DRAGOWN/CVE-2024-56898)) we are able to list all the accounts with Guest user shown below:
