# CVE-2024-55968
Exploit POC Code for CVE-2024-55968

## Description
This repo hosts a POC to a critical logic vulnerability in the DTEX Event Reporting Service. DTEX is a unified insider risk management platform. 

In summary, the Event Reporting Service was found to not properly validate incoming interprocess connections. Lack of interprocess connection validation allows a malicious actor to execute highly privileged code in the context of the service, which runs with the highest privileges on the operating system.
