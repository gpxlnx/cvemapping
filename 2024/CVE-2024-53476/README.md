# CVE-2024-53476
SimplCommerce is affected by a race condition vulnerability in the checkout logic, allowing multiple users to purchase more products than are in stock via simultaneous checkout requests.

# Detection Method
An attacker can detect this vulnerability by attempting to purchase a product at almost the same time with limited stock (stock = 1) using two accounts. If both accounts successfully purchase the product, it confirms the presence of a race condition. This can be done using custom scripts or Burp Suite turbo intruder to send concurrent checkout requests.
