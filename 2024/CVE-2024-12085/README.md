# CVE-2024-12085 Infoleak exploit

Note, this exploit is not versatile! Target module and checksums are hardcoded. Automatic checksum calculation has yet to be implemented.

`port-forwarding.py` is modified from https://gist.github.com/WangYihang/e7d36b744557e4673d2157499f6c6b5e. It's used to capture traffic between rsync server and client.

`checksum.py` is my attempt at implementing automatic checksum calculation. I didn't have enough time to finish it.

`test.sh` is a script used to test heap allocations in rsync.
