- **Impact**: Unauthorized actions such as data modification or account compromise.  
- **Affected Version**: LifestyleStore v1.0  
- **Severity**: High

## 💡 How It Works  
1. The application does not validate the authenticity of requests.

## 🔒 Steps to Mitigate  
To protect against CSRF vulnerabilities, implement:  
- **CSRF Tokens**: Add unique tokens to all forms and validate them on the server.  
- **SameSite Cookies**: Use `SameSite` attributes for cookies to prevent cross-origin requests.  
- **User Confirmation**: Require explicit user confirmation for sensitive actions.
