## Step-by-Step Exploitation Guide

### 1. Go to the Website
Navigate to the [Kanaries website](https://kanaries.net).

### 2. Initiate Login/Sign Up
- Click on the **"Log in / Sign up"** button on the homepage.
- This redirects you to:https://kanaries.net/access?redirect_path=https%3A%2F%2Fkanaries.net%2Fhome

  
### 3. Modify the Redirect Parameter
- Change the `redirect_path` parameter to a malicious site, such as:
https://kanaries.net/access?redirect_path=https%3A%2F%2Fbing.com

### 4. Trigger the Redirect
- Click on **"Login With GitHub"** or **"Login With Google"** to initiate the login process.
- Instead of being redirected back to the intended page (`kanaries.net`), you are redirected to `bing.com` (or any malicious URL specified in the `redirect_path` parameter).
