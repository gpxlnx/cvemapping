# CVE-2024-57778
**Description**: An issue in Orbe ONetView Roteador Onet-1200 allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via the servers response from status code 500 to status code 200.

**Versions**: Discovered in Orbe ONetView Roteador Onet-1200 Orbe 1680210096, but applicable to all versions up to.

## Proof of Concept
When accessing the router's menu page at http://192.168.1.1/menu.html and clicking on any option, a 500 error code will be displayed:

After this, we can activate Burp Suite to capture the application's response. Then, by accessing http://192.168.1.1/menu.html again and triggering the error, we can change the code to 200:

With this, we gain access to the configuration page:

Now, with full access to the router, you can enable or disable features, modify settings, and perform other administrative tasks as needed.
