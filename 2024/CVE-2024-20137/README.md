# About the code
This code is written in Python 3 and uses the Scapy library to craft and send custom 802.11 authentication frames over a wireless interface. 
It simulates an authentication process involving the Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), which is part of WPA3's enhanced security mechanism.
It sends an authentication request via a protocol number that is not registered or is a vendor-specific and forces the client to deauthenticate.
