# Poc-CVE-2024-57040
CVE-2024-57040 is a security vulnerability found in certain TP-Link TL-WR845N router models. Specifically, it involves a "hardcoded" password for the router's root account. This means a default, unchanging password is built into the router's software.

## Affected Devices:
The vulnerability affects these firmware versions:
* TL-WR845N(UN)_V4_190219
* TL-WR845N(UN)_V4_200909
* TL-WR845N(UN)_V4_201214

## Key Conditions for Exploitation:
* The router must be using its default login credentials.
* If the router's password has been changed from the default, the exploit will not work.
* This means, that the router must be in a factory default state, or have never had the password changed.
