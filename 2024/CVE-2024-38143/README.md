# CVE-2024-38143
Windows WLAN AutoConfig Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability<br>
Successful exploitation can lead to possible escalation to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
# Background
While on a client engagement, I had to test a physical laptop and for some reason, stumbled upon this [article](https://shenaniganslabs.io/2021/04/13/Airstrike.html) by Matthew Johnson, which was his resultant discovery of CVE-2021-28316. I wondered if it could be possible to modify and perform a similar type of attack, but what I discovered was that it actually just...worked right out of the gate. My client at the time basically said, "Wait this isn't supposed to work against a patched device". He wasn't wrong, this was allegedly [patched](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-28316) in April of 2021. It obviously was not, thus, an unfixed vulnerability. 

There's not much of a point in replicating the PoC steps once again, because in all fairness - Matthew Johnson found this bug and all I did was discover that Microsoft's previous patch was unsuccessful. If you're interested in setting up this attack, [use this guide](https://shenaniganslabs.io/2021/04/13/Airstrike.html), and remember that you'll need an unpatched version of Windows.
