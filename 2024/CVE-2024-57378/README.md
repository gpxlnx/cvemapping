# CVE-2024-57378

 ## How does this detection method work?
 
This Nuclei HTTP template checks a target URL (and its /app/login page) for the Wazuh web interface, extracts the wazuhVersion value with a regex, and confirms the page is accessible (200 status) and actually a Wazuh UI (via title and keyword match). If the extracted version is 4.8.2, Nuclei reports a match

 ## How do I run this script?

1. Download Nuclei from [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)
2. Copy the template to your local system
3. Run the following command: `nuclei -u https://yourHost.com -t template.yaml`
