# PoC CVE-2024-28157

### Overview
Jenkins **GitBucket** Plugin veersion 0.8 and earlier does not sanitize Gitbucket
URLs on build views, resulting in a stored **cross-site scripting XSS** vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to configure jobs.

### Exploitation Steps

#### Setup Jenkins (using docker):
1. Use docker to run the jenkins image.
```
docker run jenkins/jenkins:lts
```
2. Install the Gitbucket Plugin from the GUI (The most recent version of this plugin is 0.8 which is vulnerable so the exploit will work).

#### Exploit:
1. Go to New Item and create a new job. Select the item type (I went with freestyle project in the demo).
2. In the configurations, provide a simple xxs payload `javascript:alert('hello')` inside the Gitbucket URL section.
3. Save the configs and go to the Gitbucket option. Observe the xss execution.
