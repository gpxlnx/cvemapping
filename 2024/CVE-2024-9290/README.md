![cve-2024-9290 Jenderal92](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08300dd6-8788-4518-b659-d361730da69f)


The tool targets WordPress websites that use the **Super Backup & Clone** plugin and are vulnerable to arbitrary file upload. It attempts to upload a malicious shell into the `/wp-content/uploads/isnapshots/` directory. Once uploaded, the tool validates the existence of the shell and logs successful uploads into a `shells.txt` file.

## **Features**

- **Multi-threading**: Processes up to 10 URLs simultaneously for faster exploitation.
- **Custom Shell Upload**: Uses the malicious shell hosted on GitHub as a payload.
- **Logging**: Logs successful exploits into `shells.txt` for easy reference.
