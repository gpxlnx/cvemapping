# CVE-2024-28784 — Stored XSS in IBM QRadar SIEM Rule Wizard

## 🛠 Product Information

- **Vendor:** IBM
- **Product:** IBM Security QRadar SIEM
- **Affected Version:** 7.5.0 UpdatePackage 7 (Build 20230822112654)
- **Component:** Rule Wizard (Regular Expression Logic Block)
- **CVE ID:** [CVE-2024-28784](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28784)

---

## 🐞 Vulnerability Summary

A **stored cross-site scripting (XSS)** vulnerability exists in the Rule Wizard component of QRadar SIEM. The issue lies in the improper sanitization of user-controlled input within the "regular expression" logic block. Malicious input containing unescaped HTML/JavaScript can be stored and later executed in the browser context of other authenticated users.

---

## 📋 Steps to Reproduce

1. Log into QRadar SIEM with a user account that has **rule creation/edit permissions**.
2. Navigate to:  
   `Offense → Rules → Actions → New Event Rule`
3. Add a condition block:  
   **"when any of these properties match this regular expression"** .

4. Choose any property.
5. In the "this regular expression" input, enter the following payload:
   ```html
   "><script>alert(alert('XSS'))</script>
   ```
6. Click **Submit**.
7. Reopen the rule block; the malicious payload persists and triggers upon interaction or load.

## 🔐 Access Requirements

- **Authentication:** Yes  
- **Privileges:** Any user with access to rule creation/editing

---

## ⚙️ Technical Details

- **Vulnerability Type:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Vector:** Web UI → Rule Wizard
- **Injection Point:** Regular Expression field
- **Persistence:** Stored in configuration and triggered on view
- **Security Misstep:** Improper input sanitization and reflection in HTML context

---

## ⚠️ Impact

This XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to:
- Execute arbitrary JavaScript in another user’s browser session
- Perform session hijacking or token theft
- Steal sensitive data from authenticated users
- Impersonate users or elevate privileges (if privileged users trigger the payload)
- Redirect victims to phishing or malicious domains

---

## 🧪 Exploitation Notes

- Exploitation is **non-trivial**, requiring an attacker to inject the payload and a victim to interact with the infected rule interface.
- The attack does **not require social engineering** if users frequently interact with saved rules.
