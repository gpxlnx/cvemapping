The UPS management software is supposed to only allow a properly Authenticated and Authorized admin user using a web interface to configure the system.

Due to (CWE-425: Direct Request 'Forced Browsing') an unauthorised, unauthenticated remote attacker can make changes to the system including: changing the web interface admin password, view/change system configuration, enumerate connected UPS devices and shut down connected UPS devices. This extends to being able to configure operating system commands that should run if the system detects a connected UPS shutting down.
