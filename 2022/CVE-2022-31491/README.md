## Voltronic Viewpower/Pro and rebrands/derivatives
The UPS management software normally allows a properly Authenticated and Authorized user using a web interface to configure the system to run a single OS command of the users choosing when the software detects a managed UPS is shutting down. For example stop a batch job or send an alert to another system via a single command.

Due to a related critical underlying function being exposed over the network (CWE-749: Exposed Unsafe Active Functionality) with no Authentication or Authorization an attacker can use this to run arbitrary code immediately regardless of any managed UPS state or presence.
