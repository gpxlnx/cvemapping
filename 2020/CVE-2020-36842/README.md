# CVE-2020-36842 - WPvivid Plugin Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability

## Overview
- **CVE ID:** CVE-2020-36842
- **Disclosure / Update Date:** October 16, 2024
- **Affected Plugin:** WPvivid - Migration, Backup, Staging
- **Affected Versions:** Up to and including **0.9.35**
- **Vulnerability Type:** Arbitrary File Upload & Extraction
- **Required Privileges:** Authenticated User (Subscriber+)

## Description
The **WPvivid** WordPress plugin, designed for site migration and backups, is vulnerable to an arbitrary file upload flaw. This vulnerability allows authenticated users with low-level privileges to upload and extract **ZIP** files, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) if a malicious script is deployed within the extracted files.

## Exploitation Process
A **Python** exploit script has been crafted to take advantage of this vulnerability using the following methodology:

1. **Version Check:** Determines if the target WordPress site is running **v0.9.35** or lower.
2. **Authentication:** Logs in using provided WordPress credentials.
3. **File Upload:** Searches for a **ZIP** file in the current directory and uploads it via WPvivid's **AJAX API**.
4. **Upload Confirmation:** Verifies that the file was successfully uploaded.
5. **Extraction Trigger:** Executes the WPvivid import function to extract the uploaded archive.
6. **Shell Deployment Check:** Confirms if a malicious script (e.g., **nxploit.php**) is successfully deployed and accessible.

## Expected Output
If the exploitation is successful, the script will output:
```
[+] Logged in successfully.
[+] Target is vulnerable. Proceeding with exploitation.
[+] Uploading file: Success
[+] Confirming upload: Success
[+] Starting import: Success
[+] Shell uploaded successfully at: http://target-site.com/wp-content/nxploit.php
```

## Mitigation Strategies
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is strongly recommended to:
1. **Update the WPvivid plugin** to the latest secure version.
2. **Restrict user roles** to prevent unauthorized file uploads.
3. **Monitor server logs and file activity** to detect suspicious uploads.
4. **Disable direct script execution** in the `wp-content/uploads` directory using `.htaccess` or server configurations.

## Conclusion
This vulnerability presents a serious risk as it enables authenticated attackers to upload and execute malicious files on a WordPress server. Site administrators should take immediate action to secure their installations.
