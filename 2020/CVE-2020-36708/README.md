# CVE-2020-36708 â€“ WordPress Epsilon Framework Function Injection PoC

## Overview
**CVE-2020-36708** is a vulnerability in the **Epsilon Framework** for WordPress that allows unauthenticated attackers to invoke arbitrary PHP class methods via the AJAX action `epsilon_framework_ajax_action`.  

This issue is categorized as a **function injection vulnerability** because an attacker controls both:
- The **class** to call (e.g., `Requests`)
- The **method** to invoke (e.g., `request_multiple`)
- The **arguments** to supply

In effect, the attacker can direct the framework to execute PHP functions or library calls not intended to be exposed.  

The most straightforward and non-destructive way to demonstrate this is by abusing the bundled `Requests` library to trigger an **SSRF** (Server-Side Request Forgery). By forcing the server to make a web request to a controlled domain, we confirm arbitrary function execution without impacting the target system.
