# CVE-2025-45467
Unitree Go1 Hardcoded Credentials Vulnerability

#### Description
Unitree Go1 robots running firmware versions `<= Go1_2022_05_11` contain an **incorrect access control** vulnerability due to hardcoded plaintext credentials in the firmware. Attackers can leverage these credentials to gain unauthorized remote access via SSH/SCP, leading to code execution, privilege escalation, and information disclosure.

| **Attack Vector**     | Physical (Ethernet) / Remote (WiFi Client/AP modes)                    |
| **Impacts**           | ⚠️ Arbitrary Code Execution<br>⚠️ Privilege Escalation<br>⚠️ Information Disclosure |

#### Affected Products
- **Vendor**: Unitree Robotics ([https://www.unitree.com](https://www.unitree.com/cn/go1))
- **Product**: Unitree Go1 Robot
- **Versions**: All firmware versions `<= Go1_2022_05_11`
- **Vulnerable Component**: `/run.sh` script in firmware bundle ([Download](https://unitreeapp.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Go1_2022_05_11_e0d0e617.zip))

#### Attack Vectors
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by:
1. Analyzing the firmware's `/run.sh` script to extract hardcoded credentials
2. Accessing the robot via:
   - Physical Ethernet connection
   - WiFi client mode (when robot connects to a network)
   - Built-in WiFi AP mode
3. Using credentials to establish SSH/SCP sessions for full system control

#### Mitigation
Unitree Robotics has not released an official patch. Recommended actions:
1. Immediately disconnect affected robots from networks
2. Monitor Unitree's website for firmware updates
3. Physically restrict network ports until patched
