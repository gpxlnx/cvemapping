## üßë‚Äçüíª Exploit Description

This Python exploit script targets WordPress sites using the vulnerable **Processing Projects** plugin (version <= 1.0.2). The plugin improperly handles file uploads from authenticated users, allowing them to upload arbitrary ZIP files that include executable PHP code (web shells).

The exploit script:

1. Authenticates to the target WordPress site as an administrator.
2. Navigates to the vulnerable endpoint and auto-extracts nonce fields.
3. Creates a ZIP file (`Nxploited.zip`) containing a malicious PHP shell (`Nxploit.php`).
4. Uploads the file via a POST request mimicking WordPress admin behavior.
5. Checks if the shell is accessible at:
   - `http://target.com/wp-content/uploads/processing-projects/Nxploit.php`

---

## üêö Shell Usage

Once the shell is uploaded successfully, it can be used to execute system commands via the `cmd` parameter. Examples:

```bash
http://target.com/wp-content/uploads/processing-projects/Nxploit.php?cmd=whoami
http://target.com/wp-content/uploads/processing-projects/Nxploit.php?cmd=ls
```

This shell executes arbitrary OS commands and returns their output directly in the response.
