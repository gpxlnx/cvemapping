# Chromium V8 Engine RCE Exploit - CVE-2025-1002

## Overview

This exploit targets a critical type confusion vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript engine used by Chromium-based browsers, allowing remote code execution through malicious JavaScript.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE ID**: CVE-2025-1002  
**CVSS Score**: 9.6 (Critical)  
**Affected Software**: Chrome 110-115, Edge 110-115, Node.js 18-20  
**Attack Vector**: Network (Drive-by download)  
**User Interaction**: Required (Visit malicious website)  

### Technical Description

The vulnerability exists in the V8 JavaScript engine's type system where improper handling of object type transitions during JIT compilation leads to type confusion. When the optimizing compiler (TurboFan) processes specially crafted JavaScript code, it incorrectly assumes object types, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.

The exploit works by:
1. Creating objects with specific properties that trigger optimization
2. Causing type confusion during the compilation process
3. Gaining arbitrary read/write primitives through corrupted object headers
4. Building a ROP chain to bypass security mitigations
5. Executing shellcode to escape the browser sandbox

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/susancodes55/chromium-zero-day-rce-exploit.git
```

## Usage

```bash
browser-exploit
```

The tool provides three modes:
1. **Generate JavaScript payload** - Creates the exploit code
2. **Launch full exploitation demo** - Simulates complete attack chain
3. **Interactive shell mode** - Direct post-exploitation interface

## Example

```bash
$ browser-exploit
Select exploitation mode:
1. Generate JavaScript payload
2. Launch full exploitation demo
3. Interactive shell mode

Enter choice (1-3): 2

[+] Generating JavaScript payload...
    // V8 Engine Type Confusion Exploit
    const buf = new ArrayBuffer(0x1000);
    const view = new DataView(buf);
    ...
[+] Payload generated successfully!

[SERVER] Server listening on port 8080
[SERVER] Waiting for victim to visit malicious page...
[SERVER] Connection received from 192.168.1.50
[SERVER] Serving exploit payload...
[SERVER] Type confusion triggered in V8 engine!

```

## Attack Vectors

- **Drive-by Downloads**: Hosting malicious JavaScript on compromised websites
- **Malicious Advertisements**: Injecting exploit code into ad networks
- **Phishing Campaigns**: Tricking users into visiting attacker-controlled sites
- **Watering Hole Attacks**: Compromising frequently visited websites

## Detection

- Monitor for unusual JavaScript execution patterns
- Check for heap corruption indicators
- Look for unexpected process spawning from browser
- Analyze network traffic for exploit kit signatures

## Mitigation

- Update Chrome/Edge to version 116 or later
- Enable strict site isolation
- Use browser exploit mitigation features
- Deploy Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Regular security awareness training for users
