# CVE-2025-56807
# Description
A Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in FairSketch RISE Ultimate Project Manager & CRM (v3.9.4) in the File Manager functionality. The vulnerability lies in the _**title parameter**_ that is submitted when creating new folders. Due to insufficient input sanitization an attacker can inject _**HTML/JavaScript payloads (e.g., `<details/open/ontoggle=prompt(origin)>`)**_. The payload is stored in the folder name and executed when listing folders in the File Manager, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser of any user who views the affected folder. This may result in session hijacking and data exfiltration.
