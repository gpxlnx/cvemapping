# CVE-2025-31644: Command Injection in Appliance mode in F5 BIG-IP

The “file” parameter of the “save” command is vulnerable to a command injection attack, allowing an authenticated attacker with administrator privileges to the “/mgmt” web API or the SSH “tmsh” shell, to obtain remote code execution as the “root” user on the target system.

**Note:** This finding is only considered a vulnerability when BIG-IP is run in Appliance mode as this may allow an authenticated attacker with administrator role to bypass the Appliance mode security that would otherwise prevent the execution of arbitrary Advanced Shell (bash) commands.
