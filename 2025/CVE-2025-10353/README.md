## üöÄ Description

This PoC demonstrates a **file upload ‚Üí RCE** chain in the `melis-cms-slider` module.
The vulnerable endpoint accepts multipart form uploads via the `mcsdetail_img` field but fails to properly validate, sanitize, or restrict the uploaded content.
Under certain configurations, the uploaded file is stored in a web-accessible directory where it can be executed, resulting in remote code execution.

Additionally, the parameter `mcsdetail_mcslider_id` controls which slider subdirectory the uploaded web shell will be placed in.
The application begins numbering slider directories from 1, so setting this parameter to 0 causes the file to be stored in a hidden directory that is not visible through the standard web interface.

**Impact includes:**
- Remote execution of arbitrary code on the web application host.
- Complete compromise of web application and potential lateral movement.
- Data exfiltration, tampering or destruction.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Burp Suite (recommended) or equivalent HTTP proxy that supports raw request replay.  
- CLI tools for safe triage (`curl`, `wget`, `nc`) ‚Äî only for authorized tests.  
- Access to the PoC file `CVE-2025-10353.txt` (raw HTTP request exported from Burp).  
- Explicit written authorization to test the target system.

> **Important:** Do not run exploit or payloads against production/third-party systems. Use isolated testbeds or VM snapshots.

## üß™ Usage

### Basic check (Burp Repeater)
1. Open Burp ‚Üí Repeater.
2. Open `CVE-2025-10353.txt`, copy the raw HTTP request.
3. Paste into a new Repeater tab, set the proper host and press **Send**.
4. Check response for route of the uploaded file.
5. Attempt to access the endpoint provided. Example:

```
http://vulnerable-host.com/media/sliders/0/shell.php
```
