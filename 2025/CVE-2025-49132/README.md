## Guide to use script that exploit the [Pterodactyl Path Traversal at locale.json](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-24wv-6c99-f843)

### Requirements

- Exposed Redis Server
- Panel URL

### Guide

1. Get access to the server configuration file, which has APP_KEY and Redis Database Password + IP
2. Use `forge_cookie` to generate a `pterodactyl_session` cookie
3. Use that cookie to access Pterodactyl API

### Note

- This script is for educational purposes only. Use it responsibly and ensure you have permission to test the target system.
- Logging in through the panel webpanel can not be done due to requirement of "remember_token" which is stored in the SQL Database.
- Only accessing the API is possible with the forged cookie.
- Tried on panel.ahihimc.net but they patched the redis port before im able to report joy :sad:
