# Remote Code Execution via Out-of-Bounds Write in Google Chrome V8 (CVE-2025-5419)

üß† Description

This repository contains a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for a CVE-2025-5419, a critical out-of-bounds write vulnerability discovered in the V8 JavaScript engine used by Google Chrome. The flaw was present in versions up to 137.0.7151.68.
The vulnerability arises when V8 improperly handles memory bounds during optimized JIT compilation. Under specific conditions, an attacker can trigger memory corruption through a crafted HTML+JavaScript payload, leading to heap corruption and remote code execution.

üîç CVE Details

- CVE ID: CVE-2025-5419
- Vendor: Google
- Affected Versions: Chrome ‚â§ 137.0.7151.68
- Vulnerability Type: Out-of-Bounds Write
- Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Exploitability: Remote, via Web Browser
- Authentication Required: No
- User Interaction Required: Yes (e.g. visiting a malicious site)

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Summary

The issue lies in how V8 manages dynamic array allocations during speculative optimizations. In certain JIT-optimized paths, type confusion allows a JS object to gain out-of-bounds access to adjacent heap memory, which may contain critical metadata or executable code regions.
When triggered via malicious web content, this can lead to heap corruption and controlled writes, enabling shellcode injection or ROP chain execution in a sandboxed renderer process. While sandbox escape is not included in this PoC, the vulnerability forms a viable first-stage in a full browser exploit chain.
