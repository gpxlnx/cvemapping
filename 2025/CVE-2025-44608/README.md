## PoC

Step 1: Navigate to the affected URL and modify the ?viewid=1 parameter by appending a single quote ('). Upon doing so, the application returns an SQL error, indicating a possible SQL injection vulnerability. Using the SQLmap tool, I successfully exploited this vulnerability. Through the SQL injection, I was able to upload a malicious PHP file to the server. Once uploaded, I used the PHP file to execute system commands, confirming remote code execution (RCE) on the target system.
