# CVE-2025-29557 – ExaGrid MailConfiguration API Credential Disclosure

## 📝 Overview

**Vulnerability Title**: SMTP Credential Disclosure via MailConfiguration API  
**Product**: ExaGrid EX10 Backup Appliance  
**Versions Affected**: 6.3 – 7.0.1.P08  
**CVE ID**: CVE-2025-29557  
**Severity**: High  
**Attack Vector**: Remote (Authenticated)  
**Impact**: Information Disclosure – Plaintext SMTP Credentials

---

## 🧨 Description

A critical access control flaw exists in the **MailConfiguration API endpoint** of ExaGrid EX10 appliances. Authenticated users with **operator-level privileges** can send a crafted HTTP request to this endpoint and receive SMTP configuration details — including **plaintext SMTP passwords**.

This represents a clear violation of privilege boundaries, as operator roles are not intended to have access to sensitive credentials.

---

## 🔬 Attack Vectors

### 🔹 Direct API Request Manipulation

- A user with operator-level access sends a GET request to the MailConfiguration API.
- The API returns a full JSON payload containing SMTP usernames and passwords **in plaintext**.

### 🔹 API Scraping or Enumeration

- An attacker with programmatic access can **query multiple appliances or endpoints at scale**.
- Enables credential harvesting across environments, especially in large deployments.
