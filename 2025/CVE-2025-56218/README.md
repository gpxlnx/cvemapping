# CVE-2025-56218 Unrestricted  File Upload

# Description

An attacker may upload an Excel file that contains a malicious script or a phishing URL. The application converts the file to PDF and forwards it to the intended recipient for digital signature. Because hyperlinks in the generated PDF are displayed with attacker-controlled text and no warning is presented, the recipient could be deceived into clicking the link and thereby triggering execution of malicious commands
