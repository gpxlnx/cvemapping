## 📌 TL;DR

Microsoft SharePoint is under active threat. CVE‑2025‑49706, a spoofing vulnerability in SharePoint Server, has evolved from medium-severity to **real-world weaponization**, with a **variant (CVE‑2025‑53770)** now actively exploited in the wild. If you're running on-prem SharePoint 2016, 2019, or Subscription Edition, **patch immediately** or risk full compromise.

## 🧠 The Vulnerability

**CVE‑2025‑49706** affects:

* **SharePoint Server 2016**
* **SharePoint Server 2019**
* **SharePoint Server Subscription Edition <16.0.18526.20424**

### ➤ Root Cause:

The issue lies in **improper authentication handling (CWE‑287)**. Authenticated attackers can **spoof network requests**, leading to potential impersonation and elevation of privileges.

### 🔒 CVSS Score:

* **6.3 (Medium)** – CVSS v3.1
  Despite the moderate rating, its chaining potential makes it much more dangerous.

## 🧪 PoC Simulation (Ethical Red Teaming Use Only)

> 🚫 **Disclaimer**: The steps below are strictly for **educational and defensive security purposes**. Any unauthorized use against production systems without consent is illegal and unethical.

### 🔧 Scenario: Authenticated SharePoint user abuses spoofed `POST` request to trigger system-level code execution via chained web shell drop.

### 🧾 Requirements:

* Authenticated low-priv SharePoint user
* Burp Suite / MITM proxy
* Access to `/sites/<vuln-site>/_layouts/15/SignOut.aspx`
* A target endpoint that mishandles spoofed headers

---

### 🔥 Steps Overview:

1. **Log in** to SharePoint with any authenticated user (no admin required).
2. **Intercept a legitimate request** to a known vulnerable endpoint (`SignOut.aspx`, `UserProfileService.asmx`, etc.) using Burp.
3. **Modify headers** such as:

   ```http
   X-UserToken: spoofedtoken
   X-Ms-Client-Request-Id: {malicious-guid}
   ```
4. **Replay the request** with an embedded payload (e.g., dropper command or hidden aspx page injection).
5. Use **POST parameters** to upload:

   ```html
   <form action="/_layouts/15/upload.aspx" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
     <input type="file" name="webshell.aspx">
   </form>
   ```
6. **Navigate to** the dropped shell (`spinstall0.aspx`) and trigger system commands via query params.

---

### ⚡ Outcome:

* Attacker now controls a reverse shell or persistence implant via authenticated spoofing without triggering standard authN/authZ rules.
* If chained with CVE-2025-53770: full **RCE** on the SharePoint host.

## ⚔️ Real-World Attacks: The “ToolShell” Campaign

Microsoft and security researchers have reported that CVE‑2025‑49706 is being **chained with other bugs** in active campaigns labeled **"ToolShell"**. This multi-phase attack:

* Leverages **CVE‑2025‑49706 + CVE‑2025‑49704**
* Drops **web shells** like `spinstall0.aspx`
* Steals **SharePoint authentication tokens**
* Hijacks **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM** via process injection
* Installs malware payloads like `SuspSignoutReq.exe`

📌 *It’s a full compromise scenario.*

---

## 🧩 Detection & IOCs

If you're running Defender for Endpoint or Defender AV:

* Watch for alerts like:

  * `Possible web shell installation`
  * `Suspicious IIS Worker Behavior`
  * `HijackSharePointServer`
* Hunt for **spinstall0.aspx** in:

  * `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\wss\VirtualDirectories\*`

📁 **Other indicators:**

* Dropped binaries: `SuspSignoutReq.exe`, `sharepoint_helper.dll`
* Suspicious outbound C2: `.onion` or random DNS traffic from SharePoint box

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation: What You MUST Do Now

### ✅ PATCH IMMEDIATELY

Install the **July 2025 Patch Tuesday updates**:

* SharePoint 2016 ➤ `KB5002744`
* SharePoint 2019 ➤ `KB5002741`

🔗 [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5002741)

### ✅ ENABLE AMSI + Defender AV

For real-time protection:

```powershell
Set-MpPreference -EnableScriptScanning $true
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $false
```

### ✅ BLOCK EXTERNAL ACCESS TEMPORARILY

If patching is delayed, **isolate the SharePoint server from the internet** to prevent initial payload delivery.

## 🧠 Pro Tip – Custom Threat Hunt Query (Defender):

```kusto
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName contains "spinstall0.aspx" or FolderPath contains "inetpub"
| where ActionType == "FileCreated"
```

Use this KQL in **Microsoft 365 Defender Advanced Hunting** to detect web shell drops.

---

## 🔚 Final Words

This is not just a CVE with a 6.3 rating — it’s a **genuine lateral movement enabler**, already leveraged by sophisticated threat actors. If you’re running an on-prem SharePoint instance and haven’t patched since June 2025 — **you’re already a target**.

> 🛡️ Patch fast. Monitor logs. Hunt threats. Stay safe.
