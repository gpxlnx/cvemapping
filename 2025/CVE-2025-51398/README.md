A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Live Helper Chat version â‰¤ 4.61 allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript by injecting a crafted payload into the Facebook page integration Name Field. The payload is stored and executed when higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) access or edit the integration settings, resulting in stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS).

## Reproduction Steps:

1. Log in as an operator.
2. Navigate to your Facebook page integration.
3. Create new Facebook page integration, enter the following payload in the Facebook page integration Name Field:
4. 
   ``` "><img src="x" onerror="prompt(1);"> ```
   
5. Save the changes.
6. The payload is stored and executed when higher-privileged users (e.g., operator or administrators) access or edit the Facebook page integration, resulting in stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
