# CVE-2025-45778
CVE-2025-45778: Authenticated Stored XSS.

An authenticated stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in The Language Sloth Web Application v1.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code via injecting a crafted payload into the "Description" text field when creating a new project.

Once the payload is injected, every time that a user opens the page it will trigger the payload.

A simple payload such as `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` is enough to trigger the Stored XSS vulnerability.

The vendor is aware of the vulnerability and authorized the publication of this article.
