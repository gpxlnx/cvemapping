# CVE-2025-49113 Detection

 ## How does this detection method work?

This template looks at the HTML body for the `rcversion` value and then matches on vulnerable versions. Here is a mapping of the RAW HTML value and version mapping for Roundcube:
```
10502	1.5.2
10601	1.6.1
10506	1.5.6
10500	1.5.0
10609	1.6.9
10611	1.6.11
10510	1.5.10
10505	1.5.5
10503	1.5.3
10610	1.6.10
10509	1.5.9
10607	1.6.7
10602	1.6.2
10606	1.6.6
10605	1.6.5
```

**This is not an exploit script but rather a script to detect whether an instance is vulnerable to CVE-2025-49113 based on versions.**

 ## How do I run this script?

1. Download Nuclei from [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)
2. Copy the template to your local system
3. Run the following command: `nuclei -u https://yourHost.com -t template.yaml`
