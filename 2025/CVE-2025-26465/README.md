# CVE-2025-26465

The OpenSSH client contains a logic error between versions 6.8p1 to 9.9p1 (inclusive) that makes it vulnerable to an active MitM attack if the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is enabled, allowing a malicious interloper to impersonate a legitimate server when a client attempts to connect to it

## How does this detection method work?

This template matches on the following vulnerable versions:
```
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.8p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.9p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.0p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.1p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.3p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.4p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.5p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.7p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.8p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.9p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.0p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.1p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.3p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.5p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.6p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.7p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.8p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.9p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.0p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.1p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.2p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.3p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.4p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.5p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.7p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.8p1"
          - "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.9p1"
```
If there is a match, the host is considered to be vulnerable to CVE-2025-26465.
