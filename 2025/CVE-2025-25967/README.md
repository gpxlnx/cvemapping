# CVE-2025-25967: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
DDSN Interactive cm3 Acora CMS version 10.1.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This flaw enables attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unauthorised actions, such as account deletion or user creation, by embedding malicious requests in external content. The lack of CSRF protections allows exploitation via crafted requests that leverage the victim's active session, leading to privilege misuse and potential disruption of user management functionality.

Affected version: Acora CMS v10.1.1 and possibly other versions
