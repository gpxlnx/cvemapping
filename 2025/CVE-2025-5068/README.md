# Remote Code Execution via Use-After-Free in Chromium Blink (CVE-2025-5068)

**Description**

Proof-of-concept for **CVE-2025-5068**, a high-severity **Use-After-Free** vulnerability in the **Blink** rendering engine used in Google Chrome. The flaw affects versions prior to **137.0.7151.68** and enables a remote attacker to achieve **remote code execution (RCE)** through controlled heap corruption.

The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted sequence of DOM operations embedded in an HTML/JavaScript payload. Improper memory handling in Blink leads to the use of freed memory during rendering, which attackers can exploit to execute arbitrary code within the renderer process.
