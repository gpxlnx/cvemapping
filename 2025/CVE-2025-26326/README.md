Critical security vulnerability in NVDA remote connection add-ons.

# NVDA Remote Access Vulnerability Report

## Description
Critical security vulnerability in NVDA's remote connection add-ons.

## Vulnerability Details

**A vulnerability in the remote connection complements of NVDA (Nonvisual Desktop Access) was identified, allowing an attacker to obtain total control of the remote system by guessing a weak password.**

The problem occurs because the add-ons accept any password typed by the user and do not have an additional authentication or checking mechanism by the accessed computer.

Tests indicate that over 1,000 systems use easily guessable passwords, many with only 4 to 6 characters, including common sequences. This enables brute force or trial-and-error attacks by malicious actors.

A remote attacker who knows or can guess the connection password can gain complete access to the affected system, execute commands, modify files, and compromise user security.

## Additional Information

Nonvisual Desktop Access (NVDA) is a free, open-source, and portable screen reader for Microsoft Windows. The project was created in 2006 by Michael Curran.
