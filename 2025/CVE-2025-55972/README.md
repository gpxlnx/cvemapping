### CVE: 
CVE-2025-55972

## Description: 
A TCL Smart TV running a vulnerable UPnP/DLNA MediaRenderer implementation is affected by a remote, unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS). By sending a flood of malformed or oversized SetAVTransportURI SOAP requests to the UPnP control endpoint, an attacker on the local network (or via a forwarded port) can cause the device to become unresponsive. The denial persists while the flood continues and can affect all TV operations; manual control and reboots do not restore functionality until the attack stops.
