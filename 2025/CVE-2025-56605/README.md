# CVE-2025-56605 — Reflected XSS in Event Management System 1.0

**Description:**  
A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in `register.php` of [PuneethReddyHC/event-management](https://github.com/PuneethReddyHC/event-management) 1.0.  
The `mobile` POST parameter is improperly validated and reflected back in the response, allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-56605  
**Discovered by:** Isroil Mustafoqulov  
**Vulnerability type:** Reflected XSS  
**Attack vector:** Remote  

**Steps to reproduce (local only):**
1. Clone the project and run it locally.  
2. Send a crafted POST request to `backend/register.php` with a malicious payload in the `mobile` parameter.  
3. The payload is reflected unsanitized in the response.  

> ⚠️ Payloads are intentionally omitted. Do not attempt exploitation on systems you do not own.  

**Mitigation:**  
Sanitize/encode user input before output. Example in PHP:  
```php
echo htmlspecialchars($_POST['mobile'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
