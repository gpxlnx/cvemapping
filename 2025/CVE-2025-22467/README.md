## Access to the Exploit (Real PoC)

While this article outlines the theoretical aspects and potential impact of CVE-2025-22467, **the actual exploit code** will only be shared under specific conditions. To ensure responsible disclosure and prevent misuse, **a small fee** will be required for access to the working exploit. This fee helps cover the effort and resources spent researching and verifying the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Overview

### Description
CVE-2025-22467 results from a stack-based buffer overflow in Ivanti Connect Secure, a VPN and remote access solution. The vulnerability occurs due to improper bounds checking in a memory allocation routine, which can be exploited to overwrite memory and trigger arbitrary code execution.

This flaw is significant because it can be triggered by an authenticated user, meaning that low-level access is sufficient to exploit the system.

---

## Theoretical Code Breakdown
Let's illustrate the **concept** of stack-based buffer overflows. In this case, the flaw occurs when user-controlled input exceeds the allocated buffer space, leading to **memory corruption**.

üî¥ **Key Issue**
- If the input is **larger than the allocated buffer size**, the **buffer overflows** and overwrites memory regions, possibly allowing an attacker to manipulate **return addresses** or control program execution.

---

## Potential Exploitation
If exploited, an attacker could:
- **Gain remote shell access** to the Ivanti Connect Secure device.
- **Extract sensitive data**, such as **VPN session keys**.
- **Move laterally** within the network, gaining higher privileges.

### Malicious Payload Trigger Example
This pseudocode represents the **concept** of sending a malicious payload to trigger the overflow (this is for explanation purpose):
the example below is used to demonstrate the simple logic of the vulnerability, the real PoC is different...


```c
void icstrunked(char *user_input) {
    char buffer[256];
    strcpy(buffer, user_input);
}
```

```
import socket

payload = b"A" * 300  # Exceeding buffer size
target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
target_port = 443

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((target_ip, target_port))
s.send(payload)
s.close()
```

üîç **Important Note**: This is a **conceptual illustration** and **not a real PoC**. A working exploit would involve bypassing protections like **ASLR** and **DEP**.

#### Python Exploit Script for CVE-2025-22467: Batch Processing Capability

In response to the CVE-2025-22467 vulnerability affecting Ivanti Connect Secure, we've developed a Python exploit script designed to automate the exploitation of the stack-based buffer overflow. This exploit allows an attacker to trigger remote code execution (RCE) on Ivanti Connect Secure instances running versions before 22.7R2.6.

The script is capable of batch processing, allowing the user to input a list of IP addresses (such as from a file or directly in the command line). It will then scan each IP address, attempt to exploit the vulnerability, and log the vulnerable IPs into an output file. This makes it highly useful for scanning a network or a range of addresses to identify vulnerable hosts efficiently.

#### Key Features:
- **Batch Processing**: Input a list of IP addresses (in bulk) for scanning.
- **Vulnerable IP Logging**: Automatically saves vulnerable IPs to a text file for easy review.
- **Targeted Exploitation**: Attempts to exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Demonstrates the exploit leading to remote code execution on the affected systems.

#### Usage Example:
To run the script with a list of IP addresses:
```bash
python exploit.py -i ips.txt -o vulnerable_ips.txt
```

## Impact & Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
### Possible Attack Impact
- **Data Compromise**: Attackers can exfiltrate confidential data.
- **Network Breach**: Successful exploitation can lead to lateral movement across the network.
- **Persistent Access**: Attackers may maintain access, escalating privileges within the organization.

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
- **Unusual authentication patterns** in logs.
- **Memory corruption-related crashes** in Ivanti Connect Secure logs.
- **Increased network traffic** targeting Ivanti service endpoints.

## Mitigation & Defense Strategies
To defend against this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

1. **Upgrade to Ivanti Connect Secure version 22.7R2.6** or later.
2. **Restrict access** to administrative interfaces to trusted networks only.
3. **Monitor logs for anomalies**, especially failed login attempts or memory corruption errors.
4. **Segment your network** to minimize the risk of lateral movement within compromised systems.
5. **Patch systems immediately** to protect against known exploits.
