Security Advisory: CVE-2025-56608 â€“ Use of Broken Cryptographic Algorithm (MD5) in Corona Virus Tracker App India v1.0



CVE ID: CVE-2025-56608

Release Date: September 3, 2025

Last Updated: September 3, 2025

Discovered by: Aninda Saha



Summary



A vulnerability has been identified in the Corona Virus Tracker App India v1.0, a SourceCodester Android application. The app uses MD5 to hash credentials in the authentication mechanism, which is considered cryptographically broken and vulnerable to multiple forms of attack.



This issue has been assigned CVE-2025-56608.



Vulnerability Details



Vulnerability Type: Use of Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)



Weakness Reference:



CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm



OWASP M5: Insufficient Cryptography



MASVS MSTG-CRYPTO-4



Affected File:

anywheresoftware/b4h/okhttp/OkHttpClientWrapper.java



Vulnerable Function:

handleDigest() uses MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5")



Impact:



MD5 is susceptible to collision attacks.



Attackers can craft inputs that generate identical hashes.



Enables replay attacks, spoofed authentication tokens, brute-force password cracking, and potential unauthorized access.



Attack Vector: Local / Reverse Engineering of APK



Affected Products



Product: Corona Virus Tracker App India



Version: 1.0



Vendor: https://www.sourcecodester.com/android/14292/android-corona-virus-tracker-app-india-using-b4a.html



Proof of Concept (PoC)



Static analysis using MobSF revealed the use of MD5 in the authentication code:

MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");





This insecure implementation directly impacts the integrity of authentication.



Recommendation



Replace MD5 with a secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 or SHA-3.



Consider using PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2 for password hashing.



Ensure proper salting and key-stretching to improve security.



Review the overall authentication mechanism against OWASP MASVS guidelines.
