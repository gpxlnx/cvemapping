# CVE-2025-3282025

# Security Advisory: CVE-2025-3282025

## Summary
A critical security vulnerability has been identified in Copilot AI, where querying the term "PowerShell" would result in an unintended URI injection. When users requested information containing this keyword, Copilot generated a clickable hyperlink redirecting them to the `ms-calculator://` protocol. This issue could lead to unintended application launches and potential abuse scenarios where system processes could be executed unexpectedly.

## Affected Software
- **All current CoPilot deployments**

## Vulnerability Details
### **CVE-ID:** CVE-2025-3282025
- **Severity:** High
- **Attack Vector:** Remote
- **Impact:** Unintended application execution, potential security bypass
- **CWE:** CWE-601 - Open Redirect

### **Description:**
This vulnerability stems from an improper sanitization process in Copilot AI's link generation system. When a user queried Copilot AI for information related to PowerShell, the response included an automatically generated hyperlink that redirected to `ms-calculator://`. The issue was caused by a flawed URI parsing mechanism that failed to differentiate between safe web URLs and system protocol handlers.

Because `ms-calculator://` is a registered system protocol, clicking the link would immediately trigger the Calculator application on Windows machines without user confirmation. While this specific instance appears benign, the underlying flaw presents a broader attack surface where an attacker could manipulate similar behavior to execute arbitrary commands via alternative protocol handlers.

### **Potential Exploitation Scenario:**
1. A user searches for "PowerShell scripting best practices" in Copilot.
2. In the response, Copilot provides a clickable link redirecting to `ms-calculator://` instead of a relevant source.
3. The user, unaware of the issue, clicks the link, triggering the Calculator application.
4. If exploited with a different protocol, an attacker could craft a malicious scenario where arbitrary commands execute on the victim's machine.

## Mitigation
### **Planned Deployment:** April 27, 2025
A security patch has been developed to address this vulnerability and is scheduled for release on April 27, 2025. Until then, all users should exercise caution when querying PowerShell-related topics, as Copilot will continue to generate the unintended hyperlink.

### **Recommended Actions:**
- **Users:** Avoid clicking unexpected links in Copilot responses, particularly those involving system protocols.
- **Administrators:** Deploy security awareness training and consider restricting system protocol execution for untrusted sources.
- **Developers:** Implement strict URI validation mechanisms and sanitize all generated hyperlinks to prevent system protocol exploitation.
