An advanced, powerful, and easy-to-use tool designed to detect and exploit **CVE-2025-5777 (CitrixBleed 2)**. This script not only identifies the vulnerability but also helps in demonstrating its impact by parsing human-readable information from the memory leak.

## What is CVE-2025-5777?

**CVE-2025-5777** is a critical memory leak vulnerability in NetScaler (formerly Citrix) ADC and Gateway products. It allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read chunks of sensitive data from the server's memory, such as session cookies, usernames, passwords, and other private information.

A successful attack resulting in a session cookie leak can lead to a full **Account Takeover**, completely bypassing login credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## ‚ú® Features

* **High-Speed Asynchronous Scanning:** Utilizes `asyncio` and `aiohttp` to scan multiple targets quickly and efficiently.
* **Intelligent Data Parsing:** Automatically extracts human-readable strings from raw binary memory dumps.
* **Sensitive Data Detection:** Automatically identifies and highlights high-impact patterns like session cookies (`NSC_AAAC`).
* **Comprehensive Reporting:** Saves all findings to a clean `leaks.txt` file for easy analysis.
