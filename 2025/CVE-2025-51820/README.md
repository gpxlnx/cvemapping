## üß™ Steps to Reproduce

1. **Set Up the Application**  : Install and configure the vulnerable version (v1.0) on a local server.
   

2. **Login to the System**  :  Use the default credentials provided by phpgurukul.

3. **Access the Vulnerable Functionality** : /shopping/admin/insert-product.php
   
4. **Craft and Upload a Malicious File / Payload** : Upload a malicious PHP shell or inject command execution payloads (e.g., ;whoami, ;sleep 5) depending on the context of the vulnerability.
   
5. **Trigger the Payload** : Access the uploaded file or vulnerable endpoint to execute your payload:
   http://localhost/columbans/uploads/shell.php?cmd=whoami

6. **Confirm Command Execution** : The application executes the payload and returns the command output, RCE is confirmed.

üîç Root Cause Analysis
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation and sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject and execute system-level commands. In cases involving file uploads, the server fails to restrict executable file types or validate the file content, leading to direct command execution when the file is accessed.
