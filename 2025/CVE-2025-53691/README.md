### CVE-2025-53691: Remote code execution (RCE) through insecure deserialization

The same reflection mechanism in the `AjaxScriptManager` can be used to invoke the `ProcessSerializedData` method. This method deserializes a provided payload using the insecure `BinaryFormatter`, leading to RCE. An attacker can craft a malicious serialized object to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Remote Code Execution:** The attacker uses CVE-2025-53691 to execute arbitrary code on the server.
