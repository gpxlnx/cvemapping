# CVE-2025-47181 Concept: Microsoft Edge Link Following Privilege Escalation

## Project Overview

This repository presents the **`CVE-2025-47181 Concept`**, a Python program designed to illustrate the mechanism and impact of **CVE-2025-47181**. This is a **Privilege Escalation vulnerability** in **Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based)**, categorized as **"Improper link resolution before file access ('link following')" (CWE-59)**. This vulnerability allows an authorized local attacker to elevate their privileges on the system.

This program **does not contain actual exploit code** for CVE-2025-47181. Instead, it models the fundamental steps of a "link following" attack:
* **Creating a trusted temporary directory** (like one used by Edge's updater).
* **Creating a malicious symbolic link (symlink)** within that directory that points to a sensitive, highly privileged system file.
* **Modeling a trusted process** (e.g., the Edge updater) unknowingly writing a file into this symlinked path, which effectively writes to the sensitive system file instead.
* **Verifying** if the sensitive file was modified, indicating successful privilege escalation.
* **Including a conceptual monitoring system** to highlight detection challenges.

The primary purpose of this project is educational: to help understand the concept of "link following" vulnerabilities, how they can lead to privilege escalation, and the importance of secure file handling practices and robust system monitoring in cybersecurity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS CODE IS A CONCEPTUAL MODEL ONLY. IT DOES NOT CONTAIN LIVE EXPLOIT CODE AND MUST NOT BE USED TO ATTEMPT REAL-WORLD ATTACKS.**

* **Educational Purpose:** This project is solely for academic understanding and demonstration of vulnerability concepts.
* **No Real-World Exploitation:** Absolutely **DO NOT** attempt to adapt or use these concepts for any malicious or non-simulated activity. Exploiting vulnerabilities in systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical.
* **Isolated Environment:** Even for conceptual modeling, it's best practice to execute such code in a safe, isolated virtual machine environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Concept Works: Core Principles

The `CVE-2025-47181 Concept` models the following steps:

1.  ### Trusted Temporary Directory Creation
    The program sets up a conceptual directory (`C:\EdgeUpdater\Temp\`) that represents a location where a privileged application (like the Microsoft Edge Updater) might create temporary files with elevated permissions.

2.  ### Malicious Symbolic Link Creation
    An attacker, operating with standard user privileges, creates a symbolic link (`SYMLINK_NAME`) *inside* this conceptual trusted temporary directory. This symlink points to a sensitive system file or directory (`TARGET_SENSITIVE_FILE`) that normally requires higher privileges to modify (e.g., a DLL in `System32`).

3.  ### "Trusted" File Write Operation (Link Following)
    The program then models the trusted application (Edge Updater) attempting to write a legitimate temporary file (`FILE_TO_BE_WRITTEN_BY_EDGE`) into its trusted temporary directory. Due to the "Improper link resolution" vulnerability (CWE-59), the trusted application's write operation unknowingly "follows" the malicious symlink, causing its privileged write to occur at the symlink's target location (the `TARGET_SENSITIVE_FILE`).

4.  ### Conceptual Privilege Escalation
    If the sensitive system file is successfully overwritten or modified by the trusted application's write operation, it demonstrates that a low-privileged attacker has conceptually achieved privilege escalation. They leveraged the trusted application's privileges to modify a file they otherwise couldn't.

5.  ### Conceptual Detection (`SystemMonitor`)
    A `SystemMonitor` class is included to model how security tools (e.g., EDR, file integrity monitoring) might detect suspicious activities, such as the creation of symlinks to sensitive paths or unexpected writes to protected system directories.

This program illustrates how a flaw in file path resolution can be abused by attackers to bypass access controls and escalate privileges.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a Python 3 environment installed. This basic program uses only standard Python libraries (`os`, `time`, `sys`, `shutil`). Note that creating symbolic links on Windows often requires specific user permissions or developer mode enabled.

```bash
python --version

Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/CVE_2025_47181_Concept.git](https://github.com/your-username/CVE_2025_47181_Concept.git)
cd CVE_2025_47181_Concept

üíª Code Structure
The project consists of a single Python script:
cve_2025_47181_exploit_concept.py
This file contains the full source code for the "link following" privilege escalation conceptual model.
üèÉ Running the Program
Execute the main script:
python cve_2025_47181_exploit_concept.py

The script will print its progress to the console, illustrating:
 * Setup of conceptual trusted and attacker-controlled directories.
 * The creation of the malicious symlink.
 * The "trusted" write operation that unknowingly follows the symlink.
 * Verification of whether the sensitive system file was modified.
 * A report from the conceptual SystemMonitor regarding detected anomalies.
üîß Customizing the Program
You can modify the following parameters at the beginning of cve_2025_47181_exploit_concept.py to experiment with different scenarios:
 * SYSTEM_VULNERABLE: Set to True to allow the symlink-based write to succeed (modeling a vulnerable system). Set to False to model a patched system where the symlink is not followed or the write is prevented.
 * EDGE_TEMP_DIR_ROOT: The conceptual root directory where the trusted process operates.
 * ATTACK_TEMP_DIR: An attacker-controlled directory where the symlink might be created (this often depends on local attacker capabilities).
 * TARGET_SENSITIVE_FILE: A conceptual path to a sensitive file that requires elevated privileges to modify.
 * MALICIOUS_CONTENT: The content the attacker conceptually wants to write to the sensitive file.
 * SYMLINK_NAME: The name of the symbolic link created by the attacker.
 * FILE_TO_BE_WRITTEN_BY_EDGE: The name of the file the trusted application intends to write.
 * MONITOR_LOG_FILE: The path for the conceptual log file where the SystemMonitor records events.
üõ°Ô∏è Implications for Defense
This program, inspired by CVE-2025-47181, emphasizes critical defensive measures against "link following" vulnerabilities and similar file system attacks:
 * Secure File Handling: Applications that perform operations in temporary directories or handle file paths from untrusted sources must rigorously validate and sanitize all paths to prevent canonicalization issues or symlink abuse.
 * Least Privilege: Ensure that applications and services operate with the absolute minimum necessary privileges. This limits the damage if a vulnerability is exploited.
 * File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): Implement FIM solutions to detect unauthorized or unexpected modifications to critical system files and directories.
 * Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): EDR solutions should monitor for anomalous file system activities, such as the creation of symlinks pointing to sensitive system paths, or privileged processes writing to unexpected locations.
 * Secure Update Mechanisms: Software update mechanisms, especially those operating with elevated privileges, must be designed to be robust against "link following" and other tampering attempts during the update process.
 * User Training: While this is a local privilege escalation, a broader understanding of secure computing practices can help prevent initial compromise.
 * Prompt Patching: Applying vendor patches immediately upon release is crucial to address known vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-47181.
üìà Future Development
The CVE-2025-47181 Concept can be expanded for more detailed educational purposes:
 * Error Handling Simulation: Model different error states or system configurations that might prevent the exploit (e.g., symlink creation disabled, stricter ACLs).
 * Cross-Platform Concepts: Adapt the concept to illustrate similar link following vulnerabilities in other operating systems (e.g., Linux, macOS).
 * Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions: Integrate the concept of TOCTOU vulnerabilities, which often accompany link following exploits, where an attacker races to change a file's target after a security check but before its actual use.
 * Visualizations: Create a graphical representation of the file system, showing the creation of the symlink and the redirected write operation.
