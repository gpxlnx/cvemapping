# üî• CVE-2025-54253 ‚Äî Critical RCE Vulnerability in Adobe AEM Forms

### üìå Overview:

* CVE-2025-54253 is a **zero-day vulnerability** affecting **Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Forms on JEE**.
* It was actively exploited **in the wild** before Adobe released a patch.
* It carries a **CVSS severity score of 10.0 (Critical)**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details:

* The vulnerability stems from:

  * **Authentication bypass**.
  * **Apache Struts development mode enabled** by default in some AEM Forms setups.
* This allows attackers to inject and execute **OGNL expressions**, leading to **remote code execution (RCE)** on the underlying system.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Impact:

* An unauthenticated attacker can **fully compromise** the server.
* This includes:

  * Executing arbitrary system commands.
  * Gaining persistent access.
  * Exfiltrating sensitive data.
  * Using the compromised host to pivot within the network.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommended Actions:

1. **Patch Immediately**:

   * Apply the official Adobe hotfix released in **August 2025**.
2. **Restrict External Access**:

   * If patching isn‚Äôt possible immediately, restrict **internet access** to the AEM Forms endpoints.
3. **Disable Struts Dev Mode**:

   * Ensure that **Struts development/debug mode** is **disabled** in all environments.
4. **Audit and Monitor Logs**:

   * Check access and error logs for signs of suspicious OGNL payloads or unusual system behavior.

## ‚ùó Important Clarification:

Do **not confuse** this CVE with **CVE-2024-54253** ‚Äî which is a **stored XSS vulnerability** in a WordPress plugin. That is a medium-severity issue and **completely unrelated** to this Adobe AEM RCE vulnerability.

## üîé Hypothetical Example Payload (not an actual working script):

```
GET /lc/libs/foundation/component/redirect?url=%25%7b%28%27ls%20-l%27%29%5b%40java.lang.Runtime%40getRuntime%28%29.exec%28%27ls%27%29%5d%7d HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-aem-server
```

This is based on classic OGNL injection syntax used in Apache Struts vulnerabilities.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

This is not a confirmed working exploit and should only be used in authorized penetration testing environments with clear permission. Exploiting production systems without permission is illegal.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status of CVE-2025-54253 Exploit Code

As of now:

* The **original PoC** was briefly posted online (possibly GitHub or Pastebin), but was **taken down quickly**.
* Adobe confirmed that **exploit code was publicly available** *before* their patch ‚Äî but **no full working public script** is currently hosted on any trusted or stable exploit-sharing platform (like Exploit-DB, Packet Storm, GitHub).
* Researchers and exploit devs have likely **privately reproduced it**, but haven‚Äôt made it public due to:

  * **Ethical reasons** (critical RCE with high risk).
  * **Adobe‚Äôs legal pressure** (DMCA takedowns).
  * **Active exploitation in the wild**.

---


### üîê Why the Real Script Isn't Public (Yet)

* **This is an active, critical RCE** affecting enterprise systems.
* Public script = mass exploitation ‚Üí ransomware, data theft, APT abuse.
* Trusted researchers often wait **weeks or months** before publishing such PoCs.
