MCP Inspector CVE-2025-49596 Vulnerability Checker
===============================================

This script checks if an MCP Inspector server is vulnerable to CVE-2025-49596, a security issue where the /sse endpoint responds to unauthenticated requests (missing auth token).

How It Works
------------
- The script sends a GET request to the /sse endpoint of the target MCP Inspector server.
- It checks the response:
  - If the server responds with HTTP 200 (OK) **without requiring an auth token**, it is likely vulnerable.
  - If the server responds with HTTP 401 (Unauthorized), it is likely patched (v0.14.1+).
  - Other responses are reported as unexpected.

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.x
- requests library (`pip install requests`)

Usage
-----
Run the script from the command line:

    python MCP-Inspector-vulncheck.py [host]

- `host` (optional): The hostname or IP address of the MCP Inspector server (default: `localhost`).
- The script assumes the server is running on port 6277. To check a different port, edit the script and change the `port` parameter in `check_mcp_inspector()`.

Examples
--------
Check the local machine (default):

    python MCP-Inspector-vulncheck.py

Check a remote host:

    python MCP-Inspector-vulncheck.py 192.168.1.100

What to Look For
----------------
- `[+] MCP Inspector responded without auth token!` — The server is likely **vulnerable** to CVE-2025-49596.
- `[-] Auth token required. Likely patched version (v0.14.1+).` — The server is **not vulnerable**.
- Other errors indicate connection issues or unexpected responses.
