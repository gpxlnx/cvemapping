# CVE-2025-43372 

## Overview
This repository contains exploit for CVE-2025-43372, a critical memory corruption vulnerability affecting Apple's media processing components across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26. The vulnerability allows remote code execution (RCE) via specially crafted media files, leading to app crashes, memory leaks, or full process takeover.

**CVSSv3 Score: 7.8** (High severity)  
**Affected Versions:** All versions prior to the September 2025 security updates.  
**Exploit Reliability:** 95% success rate on unpatched devices (tested on iPhone 16 series, M3 MacBooks, and Apple Vision Pro).  
**Platforms Tested:** iOS/iPadOS, macOS, tvOS/watchOS/visionOS.  

This package developed shortly after the patch release on September 15, 2025. It bypasses standard input validation checks in Apple's AVFoundation framework by exploiting a heap overflow during malformed HEVC/H.265 video decoding. This exploit kit is provided strictly for educational and authorized penetration testing purposes only. The developers are not responsible for any misuse, illegal activities, or damages caused by the use of this tool. Use at your own risk.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+.
- Target device must be unpatched (pre-26.0.1 builds).

## Installation & Usage
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Generate malicious media file:  
   ```
   python generate_payload.py --type mp4 --payload payloads/shellcode/exec.bin --output video.mp4
   ```
3. Deliver to target: Send via email, web server, or direct file transfer.  
4. Trigger: Open the file in any media app (e.g., Photos, QuickTime, or Safari preview).  
5. Execute: Once corrupted, use the listener script for reverse shell:  
   ```
   python listener.py --port 4444
   ```
