### üìå Overview

* **Vulnerability ID**: CVE-2025-53833
* **Component Affected**: LaRecipe (a Laravel-based documentation generator)
* **Versions Affected**: All versions **prior to 2.8.1**
* **Vulnerability Type**: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
* **Severity**: **Critical** (CVSS 10.0)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Impact

This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to:

* Inject malicious template expressions
* Execute arbitrary **remote code** on the server
* Read sensitive files like `.env` containing **database passwords, API keys, and secrets**
* Escalate privileges or even achieve **root access**

No prior authentication or user interaction is required.

---

### üß† Technical Insight

The flaw lies in how LaRecipe renders documentation templates. Malicious input is not properly sanitized before being passed into the templating engine, leading to full control over the rendering logic‚Äîhence, code execution.

Example:
An attacker could inject something like `{{ system('id') }}` into a template-rendering route and execute OS-level commands.

### ‚úÖ Mitigation

To protect your system:

1. **Upgrade immediately** to **LaRecipe version 2.8.1 or later**
2. If you cannot upgrade:

   * **Restrict access** to documentation endpoints using HTTP authentication or IP whitelisting
   * **Disable LaRecipe** temporarily if it‚Äôs not critical
3. **Monitor** server logs for suspicious activity, especially access to documentation routes
4. **Review** `.env` and other sensitive files for unauthorized access or changes
