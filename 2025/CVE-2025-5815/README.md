# 📄 Nuclei Template for CVE-2025-5815

## 🚀 Overview

This repository features a Nuclei template specifically designed to detect an **Unauthenticated Bot Logging Disable Vulnerability (CVE-2025-5815)** in the **Traffic Monitor** WordPress plugin. This issue allows unauthenticated attackers to remotely disable bot logging via a vulnerable AJAX action.

## 🔍 Vulnerability Description

**CVE-2025-5815** arises from missing authentication and authorization checks on the `tfcm_set_bot_flags` AJAX action in the **Traffic Monitor plugin** for WordPress. This allows remote attackers to tamper with plugin settings, disabling bot logging without requiring login credentials — leading to evasion of activity monitoring on affected WordPress sites.

### 🛑 Affected Versions

- **Traffic Monitor Plugin**: Versions **up to and including 3.2.2**

### 📊 CVSS Score

- **Base Score**: 5.3 (Medium)

### 🏷️ CVSS Vector

- `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N`

## 📋 Template Details

This Nuclei template attempts to exploit the vulnerable AJAX endpoint by sending an unauthenticated request to `admin-ajax.php` with the `action=tfcm_set_bot_flags` parameter and checks for a success confirmation in the response body.

### 🛠️ Usage Instructions
