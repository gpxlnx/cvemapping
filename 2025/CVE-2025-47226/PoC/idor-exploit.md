## 🧪 Proof of Concept (PoC)

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Valid login credentials for a low-privileged user
- Access to the `/locations/{id}/printassigned` endpoint

### 🔁 Steps to Reproduce

1. Log in as a user assigned to a specific department/location.
2. Navigate to the following URL:

  https://<target-domain>/locations/2/printassigned

Where `2` is the location assigned to the current user.

3. Modify the URL manually and change the location ID to another department:

  https://<target-domain>/locations/1/printassigned

4. You will now be able to see assets assigned to **other departments**, violating access control policies.

## 🔐 Impact

- **Confidentiality Violation**: Unauthorized access to sensitive asset data across departments
- **Information Disclosure**: Inventory exposure, asset assignments of unrelated business units

## 🧩 Root Cause

The endpoint `/locations/{id}/printassigned` does not enforce proper **authorization** checks to restrict access by department.
