# CVE-2025-7955
RingCentral Communications 1.5 - 1.6.8 - Missing Server‚ÄëSide Verification to Authentication Bypass via ringcentral_admin_login_2fa_verify Function

# üö® CVE-2025-7955 | RingCentral Communications WordPress Exploit

---

## üìù Vulnerability Overview

**CVE:** CVE-2025-7955  
**Affected Plugin:** RingCentral Communications (WordPress)  
**Affected Versions:** 1.5 ‚Äì 1.6.8  
**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)  
**Type:** Authentication Bypass (Missing Server-Side Verification)  

> _The RingCentral Communications plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an Authentication Bypass due to improper validation within the `ringcentral_admin_login_2fa_verify()` function. Versions **1.5 to 1.6.8** allow unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user simply by supplying identical bogus codes._

## ‚ö° Script Functionality

This exploit automates the entire attack chain for **CVE-2025-7955**. It is designed to:

- **Bypass authentication**: The script logs into WordPress as any user (usually admin) without needing a password, exploiting the vulnerable 2FA endpoint.
- **Auto-discover usernames**: If the username is not provided, the script will attempt to enumerate it via the WordPress REST API (`/wp-json/wp/v2/users/ID`).
- **Extract required tokens**: Automatically fetches the CSRF protection nonce needed for plugin uploads.
- **Upload a malicious plugin (webshell)**: Once authenticated, the script uploads a ZIP plugin containing a PHP webshell.
- **Command execution via webshell**: After successful upload, the script demonstrates code execution by running `whoami` through the shell and prints the output.
- **Stealth & evasion features**: Uses random delays, a rotating User-Agent list, and basic WAF/captcha detection to bypass simple protections.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Prepare your malicious plugin**  
   Ensure you have your malicious plugin ZIP file (default: `Nxploit.zip`) in the same directory as the script.

2. **Run the exploit:**  
   ```bash
   python3 CVE-2025-7955.py -u http://target/wordpress [-user admin] [-id 1] [-z Nxploit.zip]
   ```
   - `-u`, `--url`      : **(required)** Target WordPress site URL
   - `-user`, `--username` : *(optional)* Username to log in as (auto-discovered if omitted)
   - `-id`, `--id_admin`   : *(default: 1)* User ID (admin is usually ID 1)
   - `-z`, `--zip`         : *(default: Nxploit.zip)* Path to malicious plugin ZIP

3. **Example:**  
   ```bash
   python3 CVE-2025-7955.py -u http://target/wordpress
   ```
   or specify username/ID:
   ```bash
   python3 CVE-2025-7955.py -u http://target/wordpress -user admin -id 1
   ```
