# CVE-2025-52689 PoC Code

PoC code for CVE-2025-52689 Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise AP1361D Wi-Fi Access Point Authentication Bypass Vulnerability.

This POC was developed for the SpiritCyber 2024 competition held during Singapore International Cyber Week 2024.

## Usage

1. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Open `exp.py` and modify the `base` variable to the base address of the router's web interface (e.g. `10.0.0.1:443`)

3. Run `exp.py` with `python exp.py`

The POC first sends the payload to obtain a valid session, then sends another packet to add the MAC address `DE:AD:BE:EF:10:01` to the client blacklist.

The returned valid session ID can be used to validate any valid web interface requests, including changing passwords, resetting the router, etc.
