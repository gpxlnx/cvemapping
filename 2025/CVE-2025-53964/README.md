## Details
GoldenDict is a graphical program for searching terms in Wikipedia and locally installed dictionaries. Various dictionary formats are supported, including the XDXF format with XML markup. Dictionaries are distributed on the Internet by other users.

The program uses a browser engine, which is included in the Qt Widgets components package, to render and display words from dictionaries.

Several security violations were discovered at once, which allow the implementation of a critical vulnerability:
1) Lack of sanitization of XML content;
2) Lack of prohibition on execution of JS code;
3) Disabled or weak CSP policy.

Together, these violations lead to the possibility of gaining access to user files by embedding malicious JS code in the XML markup of an XDXF dictionary downloaded from the Internet.
## Proof-of-Concept
PoC will be added to this page within 90 days of the vulnerability being published, or sooner if an official patch is published by the vendor.
