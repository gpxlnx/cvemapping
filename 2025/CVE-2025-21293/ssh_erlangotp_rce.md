## Vulnerable Application

Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language.

Prior to versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20, a SSH server may allow an attacker
to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE).

By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access
to affected systems and execute arbitrary commands without valid credentials. This issue is patched in
versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20.

A temporary workaround involves disabling the SSH server or to prevent access via firewall rules.

### Introduction

This module exploits CVE-2025-32433, a pre-authentication vulnerability in Erlang-based SSH servers
that allows remote command execution. By sending crafted SSH packets, it executes a Metasploit
payload to establish a reverse shell on the target system.

The exploit leverages a flaw in the SSH protocol handling to execute commands via the Erlang `os:cmd`
function without requiring authentication.

## Testing

Execute the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProDefense/CVE-2025-32433
cd CVE-2025-32433
docker build -t cve-ssh:latest .
docker run -d -p 2222:2222 cve-ssh:latest
```

## Verification Steps

1. Start msfconsole
2. Do: `use exploit/linux/ssh/ssh_erlangotp_rce`
3. Do: `set RHOSTS [IP]`
5. Do: `run`

## Scenarios
