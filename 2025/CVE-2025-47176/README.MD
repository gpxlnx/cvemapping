# CVE-2025-47176 PoC Browser Bridge

## Description
This proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the CVE-2025-47176 vulnerability simulation. It injects a crafted mail item into Outlook containing a malicious sync path that triggers an action during scanning.

**IMPORTANT:**  
This PoC simulates the vulnerable Outlook path parsing and triggers a **system restart** when the malicious path is detected.

---
## Additional Testing with malicious.prf

You can also test this PoC by importing a crafted Outlook Profile File (`malicious.prf`):

1. Place `malicious.prf` in the same folder as `PoC.py`.
2. Run Outlook with the import command:

   ```powershell
   & "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\OUTLOOK.EXE" /importprf malicious.prf


## Usage

1. Ensure you have Outlook installed and configured on your Windows machine.
2. Run the PoC script with Python 3.x (requires `pywin32` package):
   ```powershell
   pip install pywin32
   python PoC.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Inject a mail item with the malicious sync path.
   - Wait 10 seconds for Outlook to process the mail.
   - Scan Inbox and Drafts folders.
   - Upon detection, normalize the path and trigger a system restart (`shutdown /r /t 5`).

## Warning

- This script **will restart your computer** after 5 seconds once the payload is triggered.
- Save all work before running.
- Test only in a controlled or virtualized environment.
- Do **NOT** run on production or important systems.
