# CVE-2025-4918 â€“ Out-of-Bounds Memory Corruption in Mozilla Firefox

> **High Severity Out-of-Bounds Memory Corruption Vulnerability** in Mozilla Firefox  
> Exploitable by manipulating JavaScript `Promise` objects to achieve arbitrary memory reads or writes  
> Exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code or application crashes

---

## Summary

**CVE-2025-4918** is a memory corruption vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox, specifically affecting JavaScript `Promise` objects. An attacker can perform out-of-bounds memory reads or writes, leading to remote code execution and application crashes.

- **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-4918  
- **CVSSv3 Score:** 7.5 (High)  
- **Attack Vector:** Network  
- **Authentication Required:** No  
- **User Interaction Required:** Yes

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability affects JavaScript `Promise` objects within Mozilla Firefox. By exploiting improper memory boundary checks, an attacker can trigger out-of-bounds memory access, which can corrupt adjacent memory structures.

---

## Exploitation Workflow

1. The attacker prepares a malicious script that manipulates a `Promise` object in JavaScript.  
2. The script is embedded into a vulnerable web page or sent as a POST request to a targeted server using `exploit.py`.  
3. When the victim accesses the page or the script executes, the out-of-bounds memory operation is triggered.  
4. This results in memory corruption, enabling arbitrary code execution or causing the application to crash.

## Affected Products

- Firefox < 138.0.4
- Firefox ESR < 128.10.1
- Firefox ESR < 115.23.1

_For detailed version information and patches, refer to Mozilla's official [Security Advisory](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/)_

## Exploit Disclosure

This vulnerability leverages improper memory boundary checks in the JavaScript `Promise` object of Mozilla Firefox. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can force the `Promise` object to read or write outside of its allocated memory space. This manipulation allows for the corruption of adjacent memory structures, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or crash the browser.

## Usage

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
python3 exploit.py --target http://victim-site.com
```

## Detection & Mitigation

### Detection

- Monitor for application crashes or memory access violations in `firefox.exe`.
- Check browser logs for JavaScript execution anomalies.

### Mitigation

- Update to Firefox 138.0.4 or later.
- Apply patches provided by Mozilla's Security Advisory.
- Enable strict Content Security Policies (CSP) to limit execution of untrusted JavaScript.
