Notepad++ v8.8.3 has a DLL hijacking vulnerability, which can replace the original DLL file to execute malicious code.

The example method is as follows:
(Please note that the following demonstration uses npp.8.8.3.Installer.x64.exe to install Notepad++for testing, but in reality, any installed Notepad++is affected by this vulnerability)

Replace the original DLL (such as Notepad++\plugins\NppExport\NppExport.dll) with a DLL file with the same name containing malicious code (the original export function is forwarded to the original DLL), so that when executing Notepad++. exe, malicious code can be executed.

Among them, original-NppExport.dll is the original DLL, while NppExport.dll is a forged one
