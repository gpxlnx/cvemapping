# CVE-2025-34161 - Coolify RCE via Git Repository Injection

## 📝 Summary
Coolify versions prior to and including v4.0.0-beta.420.6 are vulnerable to a critical remote code execution (RCE) flaw in the project deployment workflow. The platform allows authenticated users, with low-level privileges, to inject arbitrary shell commands via the Git Repository URL field during project creation. By submitting a crafted repository string containing command injection syntax, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying host system, resulting in full server compromise.

## 🎯 Affected Versions
- <= v4.0.0-beta.420.6

## ⚡ Impact
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Privilege escalation from low-level user to full host compromise
- Complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability

## 🛠️ Steps to Reproduce
1. Login as a low-privileged user  
2. Create a new project
3. Select private GIT 
4. Insert a malicious payload in the `Git Repository URL` field (e.g. ``git@github.com:fake/repo.git; cat /etc/passwd #;``)  
5. Deploy the project → observe arbitrary command execution in the log
