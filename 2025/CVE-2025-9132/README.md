### **Technical Analysis**
The vulnerability exists within Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, specifically in the Turbofan JIT compiler's handling of array allocations with Proxy objects. This exploit targets the out-of-bounds write issue (CWE-787) by crafting a malicious HTML page that executes JavaScript to trigger heap corruption. By using Proxy handlers to intercept array operations and forcing a garbage collection during optimization, an attacker can cause an out-of-bounds write, leading to type confusion and arbitrary read/write primitives. This is achieved through heap grooming, where controlled objects are placed adjacent in memory. The corrupted heap then allows overwriting object pointers, escalating to remote code execution within the renderer process. The attack vector is viable through web browsers by luring the victim to visit a malicious webpage, requiring user interaction to load and execute the script.
