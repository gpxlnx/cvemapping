- **Arbitrary Actions**: An attacker can perform actions on behalf of the authenticated user.

## Affected Component
The vulnerability exists in the following pages:
- Wireless Security Configuration Page (2.4GHz & 5GHz)
- WPA/WAPI Passphrase Field
- Status Page (`<a href="javascript:pin_window()">...</a>`)

## Attack Vectors
### Steps to Reproduce
1. **Login to the Router Web Interface**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the router's admin panel (e.g., `http://192.168.100.1`).

     2. Locate the **WPA/WAPI Passphrase** field.
     3. Inject the following XSS payload into the passphrase field:
        ```html
        </center><script>alert("XSS Triggered")</script>
        ```
     4. Click **Apply/Save** to store the malicious payload.
   - **For 5GHz Band (wl1):**
     1. Repeat the same steps as above in 5GHz (wl1) Security Settings.

3. **Trigger the XSS Execution**
   - **For 2.4GHz Band (wl0):**
     1. Navigate to **Status** from the navigation menu.
     2. Click **2.4GHz (wl0)**.
     3. Click **"Click here to display"** next to the Password field.
     4. The XSS payload executes inside the pop-up.
