Poppler before version 25.04.0 

When pdftocairo renders a malicious PDF and calls cairo_debug_reset_static_data() on exit, heap memory containing PDF object streams is not properly cleared. An attacker with local access can dump process memory and recover clear-text PDF content (e.g.,
/stream /endstream blocks).

The specific vulnerability reproduction process(Cause of the vulnerability.pdf) and POC file(poppler-pdftocairo-poc) are attached.

The vendor (freedesktop, maintainer of Poppler) has acknowledged the issue and fixed the bug. The fix has been committed in their official repository.
