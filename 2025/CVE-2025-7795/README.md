## 📝 Description

A **buffer overflow** vulnerability exists in certain Tenda router models. It can be triggered by sending a crafted unauthenticated `POST` request to the unprotected endpoint:

Save the exploit source code to exploit.c.

Compile the code:

gcc exploit.c -o exploit -lcurl
##  Usage

sudo ./exploit -i <TARGET_IP> [-v]
# or
sudo ./exploit -u <TARGET_URL> [-v]
-i, --ip    : Target device IP address.

-u, --url   : Full URL to the target (e.g., http://192.168.0.1).

-v, --verbose: Enable verbose output (prints request payloads and details).

Examples
Exploit by IP:

sudo ./exploit -i 192.168.1.1
Exploit by URL with verbose mode:

sudo ./exploit -u http://router.local -v
🔍 How It Works
The exploit generates a POST payload of the form list=AAAA…, starting at 3500 bytes and increasing by 1000 bytes each iteration (5 iterations total).

It sends the request to /goform/fromP2pListFilter using libcurl.

On HTTP 2xx responses, it reports that the server is still responsive.

On non-2xx responses or connection failures, it issues a ping to the target IP to confirm whether the device has crashed.

⚠️ Disclaimer
Authorized testing only: Use this exploit solely in environments where you have explicit permission to test.

Legal notice: Unauthorized use against systems you do not own or have permission to test may be illegal.
