# CVE-2025-45072

Mitmproxy version 11.1.3 exposes an authenticated API endpoint at /processes, which discloses detailed information about all running system processes, including full executable paths. This can reveal installed security tools, system services, and user applications, fingerprinting defenses and planning evasion techniques. Although the endpoint is bound to localhost, any compromise of local access can lead to significant information disclosure. It is recommended to restrict and disable this endpoint in production environments.
