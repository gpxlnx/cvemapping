# CVE-2025-22252 â€“ Authentication Bypass in Fortinet Products

> **Critical authentication bypass vulnerability** in FortiProxy, FortiSwitchManager, and FortiOS  
> Allows access as an administrator without valid credentials  

---

## Summary

**CVE-2025-22252** is a critical vulnerability resulting from **missing authentication enforcement** for a critical function within multiple Fortinet products. An attacker who has knowledge of an **existing administrative username** can exploit the flaw to bypass the authentication mechanism entirely and gain unauthorized administrative access.

This vulnerability can lead to full compromise of affected Fortinet devices and administrative control over network infrastructure components.

- **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-22252  
- **CVSSv3 Score:** 9.8 (Critical)  
- **Authentication Required:** No (only knowledge of a valid admin username)  
- **User Interaction Required:** No  
- **Attack Vector:** Network
- **Impact:** Full system compromise, configuration manipulation, data exfiltration

---

## Affected Versions

- **FortiProxy:** 7.6.0 through 7.6.1  
- **FortiSwitchManager:** 7.2.5  
- **FortiOS:** 7.4.4 through 7.4.6 and 7.6.0

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability stems from a critical endpoint that fails to enforce authentication. When an attacker supplies a known administrative username through a crafted request, the system fails to verify the associated password, granting the attacker full administrative access.

This attack does not require any session tokens, brute-force attempts, or social engineering. Once access is gained, the attacker may:
- Reconfigure devices
- Extract sensitive data
- Create backdoors
- Disable security features

## Detection & Mitigation

### Detection

- Monitor logs for login events without corresponding password challenges.
- Identify anomalies in administrative access patterns (e.g., geographic or temporal anomalies).

### Mitigation

- Apply patches provided by Fortinet immediately.
- Disable public access to administrative interfaces whenever possible.
- Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and IP-based access control.
