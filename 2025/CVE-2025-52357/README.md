- Scope: Changed
- Confidentiality Impact: Medium
- Integrity Impact: Medium
- Availability Impact: Low


## Overview
A persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the FD602GW-DX-R410 fiber router's admin web interface (Firmware V2.2.14). The ping diagnostic function improperly sanitizes input, allowing injection and execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the admin console context.

## Affected Product
- **Device:** FD602GW-DX-R410 Fiber Router  
- **Firmware Version:** V2.2.14 (Build.1918.241111)  
- **Web Server:** Boa/0.93.15  

## Vulnerability Details
- **Type:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- **Attack Vector:** Remote (authenticated user required)  
- **Impact:**  
  - Arbitrary JavaScript execution with admin privileges  
  - Potential session hijacking, credential theft  
  - Possible privilege escalation and unauthorized configuration changes  

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
Inject the following payload into the ping input field and submit:

```html
"><svg/onload=alert(1)>
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98bada40-7638-4ec2-b097-0409a44825bb)

On page load, the injected JavaScript executes, demonstrating the lack of input sanitization.




## Recommendations

- Implement strict server-side input validation and context-aware output encoding to prevent JavaScript injection.
- Prevent execution of arbitrary scripts in the admin interface inputs.
- Release a firmware update to address input sanitization issues.
- Advise users to update firmware promptly once a patch is available.
- Consider deploying Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate XSS impact.
- Restrict administrative access to trusted IP ranges.
- Educate users to avoid default or weak credentials.


## Attack Vector

- Requires authenticated access to the router’s admin interface (e.g., via weak/default credentials or insider access),  
  OR  
- Can be exploited via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) if the victim is an authenticated admin who visits a malicious link.

The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious input into the "target IP" field on the Ping diagnostic page.


## Impact

- Session hijacking via theft of authentication cookies.
- Privilege escalation through browser-based attacks.
- Unauthorized router configuration changes via injected JavaScript.
- Potential for CSRF attacks when combined with network access and victim interaction.
