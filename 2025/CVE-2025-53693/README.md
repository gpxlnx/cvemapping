### CVE-2025-53693: HTML Cache Poisoning

The XAML handler, located at `/-/xaml/`, exposes several controls that can be accessed without authentication. The `AjaxScriptManager` within these controls allows for the execution of methods via reflection. The `AddToCache` method can be abused to inject arbitrary HTML content into the Sitecore cache, which can then be rendered in other parts of the application.

**Cache Poisoning:** The attacker uses CVE-2025-53693 to poison the cache with a malicious payload.

## Mitigation

Sitecore has released patches for this vulnerabilitie. It is strongly recommended to upgrade to the latest version of Sitecore XP or apply the provided security patches.
