# CVE-2025-29448
# Description
 booking logic flaw in Easy!Appointments v1.5.1 allows unauthenticated attackers to create appointments with excessively long durations, causing a denial of service by blocking all future booking availability.

# Steps to Reproduce

1. Intercept an appointment booking request.
2. Locate the `post_data[appointment][end_datetime]` parameter in the request body.
3. Modify the parameter value to a date far in the future and send the request.
4. The application accepts the long booking, blocking all future availability and causing a denial of service.
