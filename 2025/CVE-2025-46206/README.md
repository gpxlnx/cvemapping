There is a denial of service vulnerability in MuPDF 1.25.6 and earlier versions. When an attacker runs the "mutool clean poc /dev/null" command, the program will fall into an infinite recursion between the strip_outlines() and strip_outline() functions in pdf-clean-file.c until the stack is exhausted.
