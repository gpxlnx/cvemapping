# CVE-2025-56795

## Description  
Two stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were identified in the recipe creation functionality of **Mealie**, affecting all versions up to and including **3.0.1**.  

Unsanitized user input provided during recipe creation is stored and later rendered in the frontend without proper escaping, resulting in persistent XSS.

---

## Affected Fields  
During the creation of a new recipe, the following fields are vulnerable:  

1. **Ingredient Notes (`note` parameter):**  
   Input in this field is stored and later rendered in the recipe detail view, allowing the execution of injected JavaScript payloads.  

2. **Instruction Text (`text` parameter):**  
   Input in this field is also stored and rendered in the recipe detail view, leading to JavaScript execution when the recipe is viewed.
