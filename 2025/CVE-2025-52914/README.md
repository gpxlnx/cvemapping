# CVE-2025-52914

## How does this detection method work?

Versions are inferred from the below link in the html body:
```
.../Apps-Solutions/MiCollab%2010.0/MiCo....
```
Specifically the `MiCollab%2010.0` which, for example, infers the remote host is using version `10.0`. The extracted version is then compared matched against known vulnerable instances through DSL matchers:

```
      - type: dsl
        dsl:
          - "to_number(version) < 98301 || (to_number(version) >= 10000026 && to_number(version) <= 100010101)"
```

## How do I run this script?

1. Download Nuclei from [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)
2. Copy the template to your local system
3. Run the following command: `nuclei -u https://yourHost.com -t template.yaml`
