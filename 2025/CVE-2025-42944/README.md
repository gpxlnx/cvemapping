# CVE-2025-42944

Due to a deserialization vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver, an unauthenticated attacker could exploit the system through the RMI-P4 module by submitting malicious payload to an open port. The deserialization of such untrusted Java objects could lead to arbitrary OS command execution, posing a high impact to the application's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## How does this detection method work?

This detection method works by sending a GET request to identify SAP NetWeaver Application Server instances through their server headers, extracting the version number using regex, and then using a DSL matcher to check if the detected version is 7.50 or below, which would indicate potential vulnerability to the deserialization exploit in the RMI-P4 module.

## How do I run this script?

1. Download Nuclei from [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)
2. Copy the template to your local system
3. Run the following command: `nuclei -u https://yourHost.com -t template.yaml`
