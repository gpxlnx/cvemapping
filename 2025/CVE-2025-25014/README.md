## Vulnerability Description
Kibana’s machine-learning and reporting APIs deserialize user-supplied JSON without sanitizing object prototypes. An attacker who can authenticate with **High** (`pr:H`) privileges can pollute `Object.prototype` via specially crafted payloads, causing subsequent application logic to execute attacker-controlled code in the Kibana server context.
