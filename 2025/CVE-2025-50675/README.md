# CVE-2025-50675 â€“ Insecure Permissions in GPMAW 14.2

## Summary  
**CVE-2025-50675** affects GPMAW 14.2, a bioinformatics software developed by Lighthouse Data. The installer creates the folder `C:\Program Files\gpmaw` with **full control granted to the 'Everyone' group**, allowing any local user to modify files in the directory.

## Affected Product  
- **Product:** GPMAW  
- **Version:** 14.2  
- **Vendor:** Lighthouse Data  
- **Vendor site:** https://www.gpmaw.com/html/downloads.html

## Vulnerability Type  
- Insecure Permissions  
- CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions

## Attack Vector  
- Local attackers with user access can replace critical executables, such as the uninstaller (`GPsetup64_17028.exe`), with a malicious payload.
- When an administrator runs the uninstaller, the payload executes with elevated privileges.
- Alternatively, attackers can replace components within the installation folder that are executed when the application starts, resulting in persistence on the system.

## Impact  
- **Privilege Escalation**  
- **Arbitrary Code Execution**  
- **Persistence (if executable replaced in user context)**

## Proof of Concept  
1. As a standard user, navigate to `C:\Program Files\gpmaw`
2. Replace `GPsetup64_17028.exe` with a malicious executable
3. Delete components to cause errors
4. Wait for an administrator to run the uninstaller
5. The malicious payload runs with administrative privileges

## Mitigation  
- Restrict permissions on the installation folder so only trusted users (e.g. Administrators) have write access  
- Reinstall GPMAW in a secured location with correct ACLs
