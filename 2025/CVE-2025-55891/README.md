# CVE-2025-55891: Heap Corruption in TIFFCP.EXE (docuPrinter Pro) via Malformed TIFF File

## Summary

A heap corruption vulnerability exists in `TIFFCP.EXE`, a command-line utility bundled with [Neevia docuPrinter Pro](https://www.neevia.com/products/dppro/), due to the use of an outdated and vulnerable version of libtiff (v3.5.7). By supplying a specially crafted TIFF file, an attacker can trigger a segmentation fault during LZW decompression, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

This issue has been reproduced on both Linux (via the open-source `tiffcp` compiled from libtiff 3.5.7) and on Windows using the proprietary `TIFFCP.EXE` distributed with docuPrinter Pro. On Windows, the crash results in a `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` and occurs without requiring any special privileges.

## Affected Software

- `TIFFCP.EXE` as distributed in **Neevia docuPrinter Pro 7.3 and earlier**
- libtiff version **3.5.7** (original upstream vulnerability point)

## Technical Details

The vulnerability is triggered in the LZW decoding logic within `tif_lzw.c` at the following assertion:

```c
assert(&sp->dec_codetab[0] <= free_entp && free_entp < &sp->dec_codetab[CSIZE]);
```
