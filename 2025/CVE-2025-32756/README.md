## Summary

**CVE-2025-32756** is a critical **stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability** in the HTTP POST handler of Fortinet's **FortiVoice Enterprise** systems. It allows **unauthenticated remote attackers** to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted input to the [login?] interface.

- **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-32756
- **CVSS Score:** 9.6 (Critical)
- **Type:** Stack-based Buffer Overflow → RCE
- **Attack Vector:** Network (HTTP)
- **Auth Required:**  No
- **User Interaction:**  No

The issue has been confirmed to be **actively exploited in the wild**. Indicators of compromise include suspicious HTTP activity, fcgi debugging logs enabled, and log wiping behavior.

## Vulnerability Details:

The vulnerability lies in how FortiVoice handles HTTP POST requests to `/REDACTED`. An unvalidated buffer in the `REDACTED` parameter can be overrun with attacker-controlled input. Once the stack is corrupted, the attacker can hijack the return address and execute arbitrary payloads.

### Exploitation Workflow:

1. An unauthenticated attacker sends a POST request `REDACTED` to the `REDACTED` handler.
2. The `REDACTED` due to `REDACTED`.
3. The stack is overwritten, leading to control `REDACTED`.
4. Payload execution becomes possible under attacker control.

This flaw affects multiple Fortinet systems using the vulnerable component.

##  PoC Disclosure:
A fully functional **exploit** has been developed in Python, featuring **multi-target capabilities** and **threading** for efficient mass exploitation. The exploit is capable of checking a list of targets for vulnerability, saving those that are vulnerable into a file for further analysis. This tool was created to automate the discovery of vulnerable systems and to test their security posture on a large scale.
The PoC is successfully tested with the following products:<br>

- FortiVoice Enterprise
- FortiMail
- FortiCamera
- FortiNDR

##  Detection & Mitigation

### Detection
- Monitor for unusual POST traffic
- Look for unexpected enabling of `fcgi debugging`
- Review for log tampering or wiped crash logs

### Mitigation
- Apply Fortinet's official patches immediately
- Restrict access to management interfaces (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Isolate affected systems from external exposure
