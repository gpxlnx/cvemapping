## üìã Description

> **CVE:** CVE-2025-8359  
> **Vulnerability Type:** Authentication Bypass  
> **Affected Product:** [AdForest - Classified Ads WordPress Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/adforest-classified-ads-wordpress-theme/19481695)

The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to an **Authentication Bypass** flaw in all versions up to 6.0.9.  
Due to improper validation of user identity during authentication, an unauthenticated attacker can log in as **any user**, including administrators‚Äîwithout needing a password. This allows full compromise of WordPress sites using AdForest.

- Auto-detection of user ID from server response.
- Robust session and error handling.
- Clear output with admin cookie extraction.

   cd CVE-2025-8359
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)  
  Install via: `pip install requests`

---

## üßæ Valid Output

- **If exploitation is successful:**
  ```
  [+] Logged in! Cookie: wordpress_logged_in_xxxxxx=xxxxxxx
  ```
  You have a valid WordPress authentication cookie for the target user.

- **If all formats fail:**
  ```
  [-] All variants failed. Try other phone formats or check the database.
  ```

---

## üç™ Cookie Usage

Once exploitation is successful, the script prints the recovered authentication cookie.

**How to use the cookie:**
- Copy the `wordpress_logged_in_...` value.
- Inject the cookie into your browser session (using a browser extension, or DevTools).
- Visit `/wp-admin/` on the target site. If the exploit succeeded, you will have admin access.

**Example (with Chrome extension):**
1. Install "EditThisCookie" or similar.
2. Add the cookie for your target site:
   - Name: `wordpress_logged_in_xxxxxx`
   - Value: `xxxxxxx` (as printed by the script)
3. Refresh the page for admin access.
