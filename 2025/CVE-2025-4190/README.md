## ðŸ“Œ Description

The **CSV Mass Importer** plugin (â‰¤ 1.2) for WordPress contains an **Admin+ Arbitrary File Upload** vulnerability.  
Due to improper validation of uploaded files, high-privilege users (such as admin) can upload **arbitrary files** on the server, even when this should be restricted â€” for example in multisite setups.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to upload PHP shells or malicious files, leading to **remote code execution (RCE)** on the server.
