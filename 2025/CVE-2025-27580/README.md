# CVE-2025-27580: Unauthenticated Account Takeover in NIH BRICS

NIH BRICS (aka Biomedical Research Informatics Computing System) through 14.0.0-67 generates predictable tokens (that depend on username, time, and the fixed 7Dl9#dj- string) and thus allows unauthenticated users with a Common Access Card (CAC) to escalate privileges and compromise any account, including administrators.
