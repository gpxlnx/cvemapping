## Build script

## Development process

To initially create the build script, I had to make sure that I was present on the vulnerable version of the application, to do that, I read the security advisory and  found the commit hash the PoC was initially tested upon the advisory being issued:

```
b2c461e6f5e1e2f08570b2eed5b009f465dcf989
```

I used the commit hash to hard reset to the vulnerable version of the application and then started working on writing the build script, a lot of work done on the build script was referenced from the easy install utility present for the installation of the software on multiple versions of Debian and Ubuntu, I simplified and refactored the script to a concise and usable state as a build script instead of an install script, removing interactivity and hard-coding values required for our use case.

The build script thus created successfully worked and deployed the application on Ubuntu 24.04.2, running on VirtualBox.

After the build script executed and the machine is set up on the server, we initially have to enter the domain name to the server's `/etc/hosts` file, and open a browser to configure the web-GUI based setup for the application, which does the following:

- Asks us to go through the software license for the application
- Asks us to provide the DB username, password and name
- Asks us to set an administrator username, password and email for the administrator account

**Note:** These credentials are critical to note down, since we need to provide them to the student solving the lab in one way or another, since the exploit being used is verified by me to be an `Authenticated RCE` exploit.
