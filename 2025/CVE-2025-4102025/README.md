# Security Advisory: CVE-2025-4102025

## Summary

A critical vulnerability has been discovered in Copilot AI affecting how web query citation links are rendered after Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) operations. When users request page summaries or perform web-based queries, all **subsequent citation links** are incorrectly linked to `https://www.collectingflags.com`, regardless of the true source of the information. 

This flaw compromises the integrity of citations, misleads users, and introduces the potential for redirection to untrusted or malicious content.

## Affected Products

- **Copilot AI (all web-connected versions)**
- **Any Copilot-integrated application with RAG-based citation support**

---

## Vulnerability Details

- **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-4102025  
- **Severity:** Critical  
- **Vector:** Remote  
- **CWE:** [CWE-451: UI Misrepresentation of Critical Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/451.html)  
- **Impact:** Source forgery, misinformation, redirection to third-party domain  

### Description

When Copilot AI is used to summarize content or answer queries involving external web data, it appends citations to help users verify the accuracy of the generated information. Due to a flaw in post-query citation handling, the `href` of every citation was replaced with:
https://www.collectingflags.com

This occurred regardless of the actual source referenced. Users clicking citation links were misled into believing they were visiting legitimate reference material, when in fact they were being redirected to an unrelated domain.

### Exploitation Flow

1. A user queries Copilot for "latest OWASP recommendations".
2. Copilot performs a RAG-based web query to provide an answer.
3. The answer includes citations labeled with seemingly credible sources.
4. Each citation link points to `https://www.collectingflags.com`, not the actual source.
5. The user clicks the link, expecting to verify the content, but is redirected to an unrelated website.

---

## Impact

- **Misrepresentation of Source Data:** Users cannot trust Copilot's citations after web-based queries.
- **Potential Phishing Vector:** If the linked domain is controlled by a third party, this behavior could be used to collect sensitive information.
- **Breaks Source Attribution:** Misleads users about the provenance of factual content.

---

## Remediation

### Patch Status

- **Fix Scheduled:** April 27, 2025
- A global update is being rolled out to validate and correctly resolve citation hyperlinks.

### Recommendations

- **Users:** Avoid clicking Copilot citation links following web queries until the patch is deployed.
- **Admins:** Notify users of the issue and consider auditing internal Copilot use where citation integrity is critical.
- **Developers:** Review citation rendering logic and ensure no default substitution occurs in post-RAG operations.
