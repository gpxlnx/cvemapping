# CVE-2025-2760 â€“ Integer Overflow in GIMP XWD File Parsing

> **High-severity remote code execution vulnerability** in GIMP image processing tool  
> Triggered during XWD (X Window Dump) file parsing  
> Requires user interaction (opening a malicious image)

---

## Summary

**CVE-2025-2760** is a high-severity **remote code execution (RCE)** vulnerability affecting **GIMP**, an open-source image editor. The vulnerability arises from an **integer overflow** that occurs during the parsing of **XWD (X Window Dump)** files. When a specially crafted XWD file is opened, incorrect size calculations may lead to buffer misallocation, resulting in memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.

- **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-2760  
- **CVSSv3 Score:** 7.8 (High)  
- **Attack Vector:** Local (via malicious file)  
- **Authentication Required:** No  
- **User Interaction Required:** Yes  
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)

## Affected Versions

- GIMP (all versions supporting XWD import are vulnerable until patched)

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability occurs when GIMP processes XWD files without properly validating critical header values. A maliciously crafted XWD file can specify dimensions or metadata that, when multiplied, trigger an integer overflow. The result is a buffer allocation smaller than needed, enabling the attacker to overwrite adjacent memory during image processing.

This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code within the context of the user running GIMP.

---

## Exploitation Workflow

1. Attacker crafts a malicious `.xwd` image file with manipulated header fields.
2. Victim opens the file in GIMP, either directly or by dragging it into the editor.
3. GIMP allocates memory for pixel data using incorrect calculations.
4. Attacker-controlled payload overflows the buffer.
5. Malicious code executes within the GIMP process context.

## Detection & Mitigation

### Detection

- Monitor GIMP for crashes when opening `.xwd` files.
- Look for abnormal memory access or execution from `libgimpbase`, `libgimp`, or custom plugin modules.
- Use tools like AddressSanitizer or Valgrind to trace heap corruption during testing.

### Mitigation

- Apply patches when released by GIMP maintainers.
- Avoid opening `.xwd` files from untrusted sources.
- Use sandboxing solutions or open unknown images in isolated environments.
