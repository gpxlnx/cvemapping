# CVE-2025-46801 â€“ Pgpool-II Authentication Bypass PoC

> **Critical authentication bypass vulnerability** in Pgpool-II middleware  
> Allows remote attackers to access PostgreSQL as arbitrary users  

---

## Summary

**CVE-2025-46801** is a critical vulnerability in Pgpool-II, a middleware for PostgreSQL developed by the PgPool Global Development Group. The flaw allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and access the database as any user without valid credentials. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or denial of service.

---

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability arises from improper handling of authentication configurations in Pgpool-II. Under certain misconfigurations, such as specific settings in `pool_hba.conf` and `pg_hba.conf`, an attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms. This allows unauthorized access to the PostgreSQL database, enabling attackers to perform actions as any user.

### Exploitation Workflow

- Attacker identifies a Pgpool-II instance with vulnerable configuration.
- Sends crafted requests to the Pgpool-II server.
- Due to the misconfiguration, authentication checks are bypassed.
- Attacker gains access to the database with arbitrary user privileges.
