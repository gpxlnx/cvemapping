## Output

Results are saved in the `output` directory with a randomly generated file name (e.g., `123456.json`).  
The file contains information about each scanned IP and its vulnerability status.

Example result:

```json
[
    {
        "ip": "192.168.1.10",
        "ssh_version": 9.5,
        "sshd_version": 9.5,
        "status": "Vulnerable"
    },
    {
        "ip": "192.168.1.15",
        "ssh_version": 9.6,
